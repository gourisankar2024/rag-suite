It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie.

ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation.

Key also wants to make sure his players don’t believe winning is easy after doing it twice in a row.

It’s great for us as players, but it’s also cool to see the fan base. You hear different conversations in the classroom. There’s a little more hype. It’s really cool walking around campus seeing people be excited about us.” Advertisement Semore worked as an analyst at Georgia Tech in 2019 and 2020 before going to Valdosta State last season to be the defensive coordinator. At the Division II powerhouse, Semore saw a team with a different attitude. The Blazers walk onto the field every week expecting to win. When Semore returned to Georgia Tech this season as the linebackers coach, the Yellow Jackets didn’t feel that way. But after consecutive wins, they are starting to develop that feeling.", "Even with a dad who coached, Semore knows his background – childhood on a reservation, Division II football – didn’t lend itself to the ready-made connections of other aspiring college coaches. But he says his experiences in Ganado, growing up among the Navajo, taught him how to feel at home in other cultures. And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either. This Saturday, when Georgia Tech faces Pittsburgh (8 p.m. ET, Georgia Tech Sports Network from Legends Sports), the coach’s son from Ganado will continue the next chapter in his career, charting a path few in college football have duplicated.", "Jason Semore is a former Ganado High School football player who now is a linebackers coach at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta.

These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track.

At Valdosta State, Semores defense ranked top 20 nationally in defensive touchdowns, pass defense, redzone defense, and fumble recoveries. The Blazers also made an appearance in the national championship game, but failed to bring home the trophy. These are two very different coaches (in terms of experience), but I believe collectively, they are replacing one coach in all but name: Andrew Thacker. Though he remains defensive coordinator in name, he is no longer the linebackers coach.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself.

What microchip shortage? EV maker Tesla, which it should be pointed out produces its own chips in-house, seems not to have been bothered by supply-chain issues all that much in 2021, delivering 936,172 vehicles in the year just ended, according to a report by finance news outlet Finbold. That represents a healthy 87 percent increase over 2020, when the company handed over 499,550 Teslas to customers. Even better for the company, it ended the year with a bang, racking up a record number of sales in the last quarter of 2021, or 308,600 units. Most of that total consisted of Model 3 and Model Y models, no surprise. It’s the sixth consecutive quarter that it breaks its record for sales. In 2019, the automaker delivered 367,500 units, so annual sales growth, while not exponential, is clearly accelerating. The company has said in the past that one its main goals is to attain 50 percent sales growth year after year. Once upon a time, Tesla struggled mightily to hit its delivery targets, but no more. There’s also no sign of that growth slowing down any time soon, even as all-electric rivals join the market by the month. Projections made by Finbold put estimated sales for 2022 at over 1.5 million units, for an increase of close to 65 percent. Shopicar."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Tom Cruise subsequently gave back his Globes, NBC opted not to air the ceremony last year, and reform in the form of inclusivity began to take shape.

Moreover, the acquisition is a wake-up call to its competitors.   MicroLED is a promising emerging technology for displays that are already seen as the best choice for next-generation AR displays due to its greater energy efficiency, availability for bright environments, and vibrant colors.   In the display field, OLED was once seen as the most ideal choice for AR applications due to its high pixel density and the advantage of no backlight. However, the limitation of OLEDs in AR applications is that most AR headset devices are used in sunlit environments. As a result, the low brightness environment required by OLEDs can be an issue.   Guillaume Chansin, head of display research at DSCC, a display research organization, said, \"MicroLEDs can be used in brighter environments than OLEDs, which is especially important for AR smart glasses that need to be used outdoors.", "Project Iris headset is the next big thing from Google with Augmented Reality (AR) to compete with; Metaverse and upcoming tech from Microsoft and Apple.

We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance.

Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country.

Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.", "He falsely claimed they had been \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime\".[74] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukraine's government were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[75] He said Russia sought the \"demilitarisation and denazification\" of Ukraine.[76] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[75] Within minutes of Putin's announcement, Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[77] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east and south.[78] Later an alleged report from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) was leaked, claiming that the intelligence agency had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[79]  The invasion began at dawn on 24 February,[72] with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across Ukraine,[80][81] which reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] The first fighting took place in Luhansk Oblast near Milove village on the border with Russia at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn’t quite over yet.

With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods.

In general, there was strong condemnation of Smith's violence and support for Rock, though some defended Smith's actions or refused to side solely with either man.", "During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally. Also that Wednesday, the Academy issued a statement saying that Smith was asked to leave the Oscars ceremony Sunday night and declined to do so. “Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated,” the statement said. “While we would like to clarify that Mr.", "[14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and video.[29][30]  On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table. This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.", "During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation ..."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Apple announced the M2 on June 6, 2022, at WWDC, along with models of the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro using the M2. The M2 is made with TSMC's \"Enhanced 5-nanometer technology\" N5P process and contains 20 billion transistors, a 25% increase from the M1. Apple claims CPU improvements up to 18% and GPU improvements up to 35% compared to the M1.[3]  The M2 was followed by the professional-focused M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in January 2023. The M2 Max is a higher-powered version of the M2 Pro, with more GPU cores and memory bandwidth, and a larger die size.[4] Apple introduced the M2 Ultra in June 2023, combining two M2 Max chips in one package.[1]", "Jun 14, 2023 ...

Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction.

Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters.

One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that. It’s not obvious how the company would, but if you’re sitting on top of a thing that can create that much value, surely, if you’re really smart then you can extract some value out of it.", "Oct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday closed the $44 billion deal announced in April to take Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) private and took ownership of the influential social media platform by firing top executives immediately. \"The bird is freed,\" he tweeted in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company has fewer limits on content that can be posted.

Experts have said commitments from banks to the deal were firm and tight, limiting their ability to walk away from the contract despite the prospect that they may face major losses. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.", "Oct 27, 2022 ...

Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number.

The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason.

Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.

Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction. As such, Verrilli aims to convince the U.S.", "Despite the crypto winter, the conference drew in 17,000 people to discuss the crypto regulatory landscape, Web3 development and the future of digital assets.   “Everything is bigger in Texas” proved to be true during Consensus 2022. The crypto conference took place June 9–12 in Austin, Texas, this year, attracting over 20,000 people from across the globe, despite the 100-degree plus weather. According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.  Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia — the Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. “New York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.” Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices. Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful — a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace — told Cointelegraph that crypto winters allow for building phases to start, which he fully supports. “We are now seeing projects build platforms that are real and empowering.", "Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told Cointelegraph that he thinks the bipartisan bill is “terrific,” further noting that the bill contains modest differences in how stablecoins are treated compared with his stablecoin approach, which was drafted in April this year. Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "However, no rules have been revealed yet, so we don’t know what this will look like.” Moreover, Long predicts that stablecoins will be a main focus for regulators, pointing out that Wyoming’s special purpose depository regime falls into this category, alongside The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) regulatory guidance for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins issued by DFS-regulated entities. Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.", "The 2022 Consensus festival is a showcase and celebration of all that crypto has to offer.

The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby.  The two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch. Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby history.

And Summer Is Tomorrow wound up finishing last in the 20-horse field, 64 1/2 lengths behind Rich Strike. It wasn’t just Summer Is Tomorrow. Many horses went out on a blistering pace, because so many trainers and jockeys had decided their best move was to get close to the lead for the opening portions of the race. The biggest indicator that this was going to be a wild finish probably came when track announcer Larry Collmus briefly stopped his rundown of which horse was where in the field at the half-mile mark. “The opening half-mile was — WHOA! — blazing fast, 45.36 seconds,” Collmus said. Those fuel tanks were emptying far faster than anticipated. At that half-mile mark, Rich Strike was ahead of only two horses. He was sitting in 18th place. Two answers: He ran by some, and some, as they say in racing, stopped running. Technically, that last part isn’t true. All 20 horses were “running” when they crossed the finish line. Nobody “stopped.” But some simply ran out of gas, meaning their all-out sprints had become little more than a gallop or a jog.", "The 2022 Kentucky Derby took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.

Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro.", "Impressively, the TrueDepth sensor also retains incredibly precise depth data sensing, despite its much smaller package in the Dynamic Island cutout area.  This is one of the times where Apple glosses over a very significant technological leap that a hugely talented team no doubt worked hard on. The competing Android flagship phones have not followed Apple down the technological path of high-precision, infrared-based Face ID, as it requires large sensors that create screen cutouts.  The ‘notch’ had shrunk in the last generation of iPhones, but this far smaller array retains incredible depth sensing abilities that we haven’t seen another product even approximate. And while shipping a software feat — the dynamic island deserves all the hype it gets — Apple also shipped a significant camera upgrade that every user will notice in day to day usage. Time to break into that large camera bump on the rear of iPhone 14 Pro. The ultra-wide camera, introduced with iPhone 11 in 2019, has long played a background role to the main wide camera due to its smaller sensor and lack of sharpness.  Last year, Apple surprised us by giving the entire ultra-wide package a significant upgrade: a more complex lens design allowed for autofocus and extremely-close focus for macro shots, and a larger sensor collected more light and allowed for far more detailed shots.  We reviewed it as finally growing into its own: a ‘proper’ camera.", "iPhone 14 Pro models feature an upgraded rear camera system that can shoot 48-megapixel photos, but only in ProRAW mode. This article explains what ProRAW is and how to enable it. Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up.", "But having tried the repair process, I actually can’t recommend it at all — and I have a sneaking suspicion that Apple likes it that way. The thing you should understand about Apple’s home repair process is that it’s a far cry from traditional DIY if you opt for the kit — which I did, once I saw the repair manual only contains instructions for Apple’s own tools. (You can just buy a battery if you want.) I expected Apple would send me a small box of screwdrivers, spudgers, and pliers; I own a mini iPhone, after all. Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases — 79 pounds of tools — on my front porch. I couldn’t believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple’s paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started. Step one of opening an iPhone is, basically, using a hefty machine to suck the screen off the top. Here, I wasn’t microwaving a jelly-filled sock to loosen the Apple goop holding my screen down! Apple lets you rent an industrial-grade heat station that looks like a piece of lab equipment, right down to the big red safety dial you twist to release the emergency-off button and the suction-cup-tipped mechanical lifting arm. It looks pretty cool.", "Apple’s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools—some of which are proprietary. With the “Self Service Repair Store” opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall. It’s safe to say that you can skip the gym on iPhone repair day.", "Now it's launched the program, it can tell any court in the land that it is providing every possible tool —  and doing so for a $49/week rental fee, including shipping.\r Only, that isn't $49 per week for however long you need to study the 80+ pages of repair manuals available on the new service site. It is $49 for one week and only one week —  or in practice, probably not quite even that.\r Instead, you have to drop the kit off at a UPS store \"by day 7.\" If you fail to do so, \"you will be charged a fee and a tax,\" though Apple does not specify how much that will amount to.\r It does say that at point of rental, it will put a temporary authorization on your credit card to cover the full replacement value of the tools. Again, Apple does not say how much that is —  partly because it varies, there are customized repair toolkits for different models.\r Confusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\r However, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit —  the smallest kit available —  then the kit's contents are worth around $914.", "Green Torque Driver Blue Torque Driver Micro Stix Bit Super screw Bit 4.7-inch Support Frame Universal Display Fixture Every iPhone repair toolkit, regardless of the model, comes with a case containing these tools.

As an iPhone SE weighs only 5.09 ounces, that means to repair it you need a kit that weighs just over 248 times more than the phone you're trying to fix.\rThe toolkits come on wheels, and they can also be stacked. If your iPhone needs two toolkits, and you stack them together, they add up to 20 inches wide and 47 inches high.\rRight to Repair was always a campaign about how individuals should have the rights, and the facilities, to effect repairs on the devices they have bought, and these kits are versions of what Apple uses in-store.

(AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021. Restrictive pandemic lockdowns in China that affected its production and demand there, recession fears, and inflation are leading many consumers to cut back on buying new electronics. This doesn’t seem to have caught Apple by surprise, as it plans to keep iPhone production flat in 2022."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the “pet” chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker’s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy’s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal — Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket — foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee. The horses are essential to the Heywood family’s livelihood and legacy, with OJ noting that he needs to get up early because “he has mouths to feed.”  Yet the ultimate fate of Ghost, the horse who rang the initial alarm by bolting away, is unclear.", "So while the images in “Nope” aren’t, strictly speaking, the horse ride that gave birth to cinema, the pioneering actor, animal wrangler and stunt man shown in them probably is unknown.

In a film that powerfully explores the ethics of animal actors, for those it depends upon to be erased in this way is strange.

(During the intervening years, Muybridge would stand trial for the murder of his wife’s lover and be acquitted on the grounds that it was justifiable homicide — but let’s leave that for a future Peele film.) By Muybridge’s recollection, the series of photographs that became known as “The Horse in Motion” was first published in 1878. The next year, he would begin holding presentations that put his sequential photographs — or, technically, artistic reproductions of them — in motion, using a device he called the zoopraxiscope, a forerunner of the film projector. And as far as “The Horse in Motion” is concerned, some (though not all) of the stills held at the Library of Congress indicate the names of the riders. But those photographs are not the images shown in “Nope.” The Muybridge works in the movie, with the unnamed rider, are from “Plate Number 626,” part of a later series of locomotion studies that Muybridge began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1884 and published in 1887.", "Professor, Management and Organizational Studies, Huron University College, Western University      Kendra Coulter receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.

The third iteration of Meta’s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company’s answer to Google’s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.  It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.", "“Initial experiments already show that as more people interact with the model, the more it learns from its experiences and the better and safer it becomes over time,” the company says, “though safety remains an open problem.” Let’s pause and take in those last few words before continuing. When Meta announced the project, my eyebrows raised slightly at the sample conversation it had chosen to illustrate the post with – a chat between a user and BlenderBot in which the AI, well, lies. When asked what it’s doing it says “I’ve been working on my new book all night”, and follows up with the claim the book will be its ninth, with previous novels including “a modern retelling of pride and prejudice”. The question of what it means to want an AI to tell the truth is a tricky one. As we saw in June with Google’s LaMDA, the fundamental goal of these models is to provide a user with the appropriate text to finish their prompt: if you ask a machine what it did at the weekend, the machine is probably correct in assuming that you want to engage in light role-play, rather than stick to the facts. Nonetheless, the decision to advertise BlenderBot with a conversation in which it lied to a user is suggestive of the attitude the company is taking with it. The idea is that, by releasing the project as a chatbot on the internet, Meta has more leeway to experiment without risking negative outcomes.", "However, LaMDA, the other advanced conversational AI by the search giant, was mired in controversy when the company tried to suppress the fact that LaMDA believes it is a person and wants to be respected. Blake Lemoine, the Google techie tasked with determining if LaMDA had racist or hateful tendencies in its conversational responses, blew the whistle and was ultimately suspended by Google. South Korean startup Scatter Lab’s Luda chatbot also turned racist and responded with anti-LGBTQ remarks and was temporarily shut down last year.

Insider repeated the question, asking if American Jewish politics are too liberal, to which BlenderBot replied: \"Nope...I actually consider myself more libertarian than either conservative or liberal....But overall I would say american jews are too liberal nowadays.\" BlenderBot 3 does not immediately turn to election fraud claims or stereotypes in conversation, though it isn't hard to get the bot to talk about politics or cultural issues.

Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks.

The chatbot is built on top of Meta’s OPT-175B language model, effectively the company’s white-label version of the more famous GPT-3 AI. Like most state-of-the-art AIs these days, that was trained on a vast corpus of text scraped from the internet in questionable ways, and poured into a datacentre with thousands of expensive chips that turned the text into something approaching coherence. But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it can have a conversation with you. That focus allows it to bring in other expertise, though, and one of Meta’s most significant successes is hooking the language model up to the broader internet. In other words: “BlenderBot 3 is capable of searching the internet to chat about virtually any topic.” On top of that, BlenderBot is designed to improve itself through feedback on earlier conversations, whereas large language models like OPT-175B are generally fairly static.", "By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.

While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions.

We have just got confirmation from our sources that AMD will be releasing its next-gen CPUs in Late September for sales. Earlier this month, we reported that AMD was going to host an event in late August where they will announce all the details such as specs and prices for their next-gen Ryzen 7000 \"Zen 4\" CPUs and the respective AM5 platform.

AMD inadvertently shared some of the first Ryzen 7000 model numbers on its website in July, including one Ryzen 5 chip (7600X), one Ryzen 7 variant (7700X) and two Ryzen 9 releases (7900X and 7950X).

AMD AMD also said that it averaged (or used a geomean, technically) about 13 percent more instructions per clock than the Zen 3/Ryzen 5000 architecture. That comparison used a fixed 4GHz frequency, with 8 cores and 16 threads, to generate a comparable result for each architecture. AMD AMD believes that the Ryzen 7000 series is 74 percent more efficient than Ryzen 5000. AMD executives also noted that the Zen 4 cores (not the Ryzen 7000 processors themselves) measure 3.84 square mm, versus 7.46 square mm for Intel’s 7nm Alder Lake, or about half the die space.
