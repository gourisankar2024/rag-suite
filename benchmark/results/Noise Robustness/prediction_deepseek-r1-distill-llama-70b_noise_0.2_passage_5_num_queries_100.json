It mentions that the show features a father-and-daughter heart surgeon team, which fits into the medical drama category. The plot involves them dealing with familial drama while saving patients, which adds a layer of family drama to the typical medical procedural elements.\n\nThe document also points out that the show includes scenes like heart surgery and other medical emergencies, which are common in medical dramas. Additionally, it highlights the diversity in the cast and the inclusion of interracial relationships, which are aspects that can be part of both medical and family dramas but don't necessarily define the genre.\n\nThere's a comparison made with other shows like \"Grey’s Anatomy\" and \"The Good Doctor,\" both of which are well-known medical dramas. This further supports the idea that \"Good Sam\" belongs to the same genre.\n\nThe presence of familial conflict and the focus on character relationships, especially between the father and daughter, suggest that it's not just a straightforward medical show but also delves into personal and family issues, which might make it a hybrid of medical drama and family drama. However, the primary setting and the main plot points are centered around a hospital and surgical procedures, which are hallmarks of medical dramas.\n\nTherefore, combining all these elements, the genre of \"Good Sam\" is a medical procedural with elements of family drama. However, the primary and overarching genre is medical drama, as the show's core revolves around the medical field and surgical cases, with the family dynamics adding depth to the characters and plotlines.\n</think>\n\nThe genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is a medical procedural, specifically a medical drama with elements of family drama.", "docs": ["Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas.

Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.", "The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith.

So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey’s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam’s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed “dysfunctional family dramas”.  ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation.

There's a mention of single-game tickets going on sale in the near future, but the question is about season tickets, so that's not relevant here. \n\nI also notice that the document repeats some sections, but each time it mentions the 2022 season tickets, it consistently states that they cost $100 per seat. There's no variation or different pricing mentioned for 2022 season tickets. \n\nAdditionally, there's information about single-game pricing in different sections, but again, the focus is on season tickets. The document also talks about the benefits of season tickets, like having the same seat for all games and a discounted rate compared to single-game tickets. \n\nI don't see any other figures mentioned for 2022 season tickets. The later part of the document talks about 2023 tickets, but that's not relevant to the question. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the information is consistent and clear: 2022 season tickets are $100 each. There's no conflicting data or other prices mentioned for that specific season. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of discounts or special pricing that might affect the cost, but the document doesn't indicate any such offers for 2022 season tickets. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided document, the answer is that Georgia Tech 2022 softball season tickets cost $100 per seat.\n</think>\n\nThe cost for Georgia Tech softball 2022 season tickets is $100 per seat.

He said that while there are 200 million game console users worldwide, the mobile market reaches over 3 billion people.[16] In a statement released on Activision Blizzard's investor website, the company said its industry is the \"most dynamic and exciting category of entertainment across all platforms\" and that gaming will be the forefront of the development of the emerging metaverse.

We’ve compiled a recap to keep you abreast of the Activision Blizzard deal’s trials and tribulations. Due to the scale of the deal, regulators around the world fear that this acquisition may hurt competition and give Microsoft — which already owns Xbox — too much power in the gaming market. Fears have centred around the potential effect on market share in the console gaming market.

While millions of people will be tuning into the intense NFL action between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, a large sum will be even more excited for the iconic commercials. The cost for a 30-second commercial during this year’s Super Bowl is reaching a record-high amount, with advertisers hoping their ad makes a bang for the viewers. Ahead of the game, let’s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes. In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:  Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.", "Normally, fans don't pay too much attention to commercials during a sporting event. But, the one time of year that viewers actually want to see commercials is during the Super Bowl. Super Bowl 56 is no different. The Bengals will face the Rams for the game, and a rap performance featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will take place during the halftime show. But, in between all of the action, there will be a long list of new, and possibly iconic, Super Bowl commercials. In order to get your company a spot during the Super Bowl commercials, you must pay a pretty penny. Here's what you need to know about how much Super Bowl commercials cost. MORE: The 25 best Super Bowl commercials of all time, ranked NBC, the home for Super Bowl 56, has not reported the official prices for each Super Bowl ad spot, but it was reported back in September by Dan Lovinger of NBC Sports Group that the spots were selling quickly and for an upwards of $6.5 million for a 30-second ad. This year's price is the most expensive Super Bowl ad price in NFL history. This price is about a 20 percent increase from the last time NBC hosted the Super Bowl in 2018.

While there are moments when the series can lose its momentum, there’s no question that it is a provocative exploration of the criminal psyche. It’s hard to think of a more famous fictional serial killer than Hannibal Lecter, who has appeared in multiple forms, including books, movies, and, of course, the TV series that bears his name. There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series. Like other great serial crime dramas, one of the most appealing things about The Endgame is the light that it sheds on the workings of the FBI.

Even now, Russia's leader describes the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two as a \"special military operation\". Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country.  His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.  He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine's neutral status.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.", "Northeastern Ukraine campaign  Eastern Ukraine campaign  Southern Ukraine campaign  2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive  Other regions  Naval operations  Spillover and cross-border incidents  Resistance  Related  Attacks on civilians  On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War which began in 2014.

I remember hearing that Apple released the iPhone 14 series, which includes the iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, and 14 Pro Max. I think each model might have different chips, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLooking at the documents provided, the first document mentions that the A16 chip is in the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. It says that the A16 has nearly 16 billion transistors, which is a slight increase from the A15's 15 billion. The document also notes that the A14 has 11.8 billion and the A13 has 8.5 billion transistors. It also talks about the Geekbench test results showing a 10% improvement in single-threaded tasks for the A16 compared to the A15.\n\nThe second document by Mitchell Clark states that the regular iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will use the A15 Bionic chip, the same as in the iPhone 13 Pro. However, it adds that this A15 has an extra GPU core compared to the one in the regular iPhone 13 and the SE. This is the first time since the iPhone 3G that a flagship iPhone didn't get a new processor.\n\nThe third document mentions that the A16 costs more to produce because it's using TSMC's 4nm process, whereas the A15 is on 5nm. It also references Geekbench results showing the A16 is 15-17% faster in multi-core tasks than the A15.\n\nThe fourth document seems to be about identifying iPhone models by their model numbers but doesn't directly answer the chip question.\n\nPutting this together, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use the A15 chip, while the Pro models have the A16. The A15 in the iPhone 14 is the same as the one in the iPhone 13 Pro but with an extra GPU core. The A16 is a newer, more efficient chip but only in the Pro models.\n\nI think the answer is that the iPhone 14 has the A15 Bionic chip, while the Pro models have the A16. So the specific answer to the question \"What chip does the iPhone 14 have?\" is the A15 Bionic chip.\n</think>\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are equipped with the A15 Bionic chip, which is the same as the one found in the iPhone 13 Pro but includes an additional GPU core for enhanced performance. \n\n**Answer:**  \nThe iPhone 14 has the A15 Bionic chip.", "docs": ["With the A16, Apple's transistor count increased only modestly from 15 billion transistors on the A15. The A16 has \"nearly 16 billion transistors,\" Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak said. The A14 has 11.8 billion transistors, and the A13 has 8.5 billion transistors. You may not notice new chip performance directly, but it's key to delivering new abilities, like the iPhone 14 Pro's advanced photo and video processing. The act of taking a photo exercises the A16's CPU, GPU, image processor and neural engine, cranking out up to 4 trillion operations per photo to deliver an image. Unlike with previous iPhone generations, the A16 will only be available in Apple's higher-end iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models. The more mainstream iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will make do with the A15 chip that Apple debuted in 2021. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A reported Geekbench test result shows modest performance gains overall. In single threaded tasks, which depend on the speed of an individual CPU core to do one important job, performance rose a significant 10% from a score of 1,707 on the iPhone 13 Pro to 1,879 on the iPhone 14 Pro, according to a test result spotted by MacRumors.", "By  Mitchell Clark Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won’t be getting a new processor this year — instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple’s A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that’s in the iPhone 13 Pro — though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn’t quite over yet. Using tried and true chips that Apple’s manufacturer already has experience making could help ensure that there are enough processors to meet demand.", "Apple's new A16 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max costs $110 to produce, making it over 2.4× as costly as the A15 chip in iPhone 13 Pro models released last year, according to a Nikkei Asia report. The A16's higher cost is likely due in part to the chip being manufactured based on TSMC's 4nm process, while the A15 is a 5nm chip. iPhone chips could continue to increase in price as miniaturization continues, with rumors suggesting the A17 chip in iPhone 15 Pro models will be based on TSMC's 3nm process, and a DigiTimes report this week claiming that TSMC will begin volume production of 2nm chips in 2025. Geekbench 5 benchmark results indicate the A16 chip delivers around 15% to 17% faster multi-core performance compared to the A15 chip.

However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]", "On 14 November 2019, CNSA invited some foreign embassies and international organizations to witness hovering and obstacle avoidance test for the Mars Lander of China's first Mars exploration mission at the extraterrestrial celestial landing test site.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.", "It was one of the most infamous moments in Academy Awards history that became known as \"the slap.\" The world could not stop talking about Will Smith striking comedian Chris Rock onstage at the 2022 Oscars after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.  A lot has happened since the slap: Will Smith apologized (twice) and was banned from Academy events for 10 years. Chris Rock finally addressed the incident in-depth during a live comedy special, nearly a year after it happened. And the 2023 Oscars went down without any slaps – though the moment was certainly a talker during the show. Here's everything to know about the slap and everything that's happened since. The controversy began when Rock appeared onstage to present the Academy Award for best documentary feature during the 2022 Oscars ceremony. In his introduction, Rock made a joke about a possible \"G.I. Jane\" sequel in reference to Pinkett Smith's bald head. Smith appeared to first laugh at Rock's joke, though Pinkett Smith rolled her eyes and looked upset. Afterward, Smith walked up to the stage, slapped Rock and returned to his seat amid confusion in the crowd about whether the segment was scripted or real.  \"Will Smith just slapped the (expletive) out of me,\" Rock deadpanned to the audience.", "[14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and video.[29][30]  On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table. This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.", "During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation ...", "Filed under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation. Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. “I did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,” marveled Diddy shortly after. “This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. “We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.” Here’s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

Trading in company shares was suspended Friday on the New York Stock Exchange and the stock will be officially delisted early next month, according to a filing with securities regulators.

The world’s richest man spent months trying to back out of the $44 billion purchase agreement he originally signed in April.

As for why Musk wanted to own Twitter in the first place, the reasons are more complicated. “There has been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I think about advertising,” he said in an open letter Thursday to companies that sell ads on Twitter, which is how the company makes money. “Most of it has been wrong.", "At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said.

But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Mr. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, tried debunking Mr. Musk’s claims, Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji.

Twitter sued Mr. Musk to force him to carry out the agreement.

Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.

Indeed, iPhone 14 Pro was announced with a 48 megapixel camera. Looking purely at the specs, it’s an impressive upgrade: the sensor is significantly larger in size, not just resolution. The lens is slightly slower (that is, its aperture isn’t quite as large as the previous years’) but once again, the overall light-gathering ability of the iPhone’s main shooter improves by as much as 33%.  The implications are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.  There’s a reason we chase the dragon of larger sensors in cameras; they allow for all our favorite photography subjects: details, low light and night shots, and nice bokeh. Your average digital camera sensor has a particularly interesting way to capture color. We’ve previously detailed this in our post about ProRAW, which you can read here, but we’ll quickly go over it again. Essentially, a camera sensor contains tiny pixels that can detect how much light comes in.

I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an “advanced quad-pixel sensor.” However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.", "I took the iPhone 14 Pro on a trip around San Francisco and Northern California, to the remote Himalayas and mountains of the Kingdom of Bhutan, and Tokyo — to test every aspect of its image-making, and I have to say that I was pretty blown away by the results of the main camera. While arguably, a quad-bayer sensor should not give true 48-megapixel sensor resolution as one might get from, say, a comparable ‘proper’ digital camera, the results out of the iPhone 14 Pro gave me chills. I have simply never gotten image quality like this out of a phone. There’s more here than just resolution; the way the new 48 megapixel sensor renders the image is unique and simply tremendously different than what I’ve seen before. These photos were all shot in Apple’s ProRAW format and further developed in Lightroom or other image editors like Apple’s own Photos app. I was very impressed with the latitude of these files; I tend to expose my image for the highlights, shooting intentionally dark to boost shadows later, and these files have plenty of shadow information to do just that:  Detail-wise, we can see quite easily that it’s an incredible leap on previous iPhones, including the iPhone 13 Pro: It helps that Bhutan is essentially a camera test chart, with near-infinite levels of detail in their decorations to pixel-peep: Comparing to the iPhone 13 Pro, the comparison seems downright unfair."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

According to a press release put out by Netflix on Tuesday, the staggering sum will be the largest cash prize ever offered on reality television.  “‘Squid Game’ took the world by storm with [director] Hwang Dong-hyuk’s captivating story and iconic imagery,” Netflix VP Brandon Rieg said in the release. “We’re grateful for his support as we turn the fictional world into reality in this massive competition and social experiment.” Casting is currently open to English-language speakers over the age of 21 at SquidGameCasting.com. The reality show will feature 10 episodes and production is expected to take place over four weeks.

It became an international sensation, and it holds the record as Netflix's most popular series of all-time, according to the company.

There, the show struck a particular nerve for highlighting a deeply entrenched issue: debt and the perennial struggle of paying it off. And shortly after its debut, companies hoping to capitalize off its popularity rushed to incorporate the show into ad campaigns — a move that was perceived as crass due to the sensitive themes in the Korean thriller. \"Squid Game\" has also inspired celebrities to re-create scenes from the show — sparking similar controversy.

OJ asks those on a television set not to look Lucky in the eye early in the film, a foreshadowing of later extra-terrestrial communication.  As a lifelong horsewoman, I can confirm that horses generally have no concerns about eye contact. Recent studies have found that they are not only attuned to human facial expressions, but also have more than a dozen of their own. Granted, the aversion could be particular to Lucky. Without question, the real horse (or perhaps horses) who plays Lucky is extraordinary. Most horses are fearful of blowing objects.

This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the “pet” chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker’s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy’s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal — Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket — foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee.

Just ask Microsoft’s “teen” chatbot Tay—except you can’t, because Tay was taken down when it started reproducing sexist and racist remarks shortly after it launched in 2016. Meta apparently believes that AI can learn to do better. The company just announced BlenderBot 3, a much more advanced chatbot designed to learn through conversation without getting into the kind of trouble that derailed Tay. And the company has made it available for anyone to try out. BlenderBot 3 learns facts by searching the web and retains information from all previous conversations as well as within a particular chat. It uses a new machine learning approach to identify trolls in order to ignore them. Meta’s technology also uses advances in AI that have produced much more linguistically capable computer programs in recent years. Training a particular type of artificial neural network on huge amounts of text data scraped from the web can produce algorithms capable of summarizing or generating text and that are able to hold conversations that can be more coherent and wide-ranging than the canned remarks of conventional chatbots.", "For example, you can react to each chat message in our BlenderBot 3 demo by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks.

The bot is called BlenderBot 3 and can be accessed on the web. (Though, right now, it seems only residents in the US can do so.)

Like all LLMs, BlenderBot is initially trained on vast datasets of text, which it mines for statistical patterns in order to generate language. Such systems have proved to be extremely flexible and have been put to a range of uses, from generating code for programmers to helping authors write their next bestseller.", "Facebook’s parent company has created a bot capable of weighing in on almost any topic – from radicalisation to sending Mark Zuckerberg to jail Last week, researchers at Facebook’s parent company Meta released BlenderBot 3, a “publicly available chatbot that improves its skills and safety over time”. The chatbot is built on top of Meta’s OPT-175B language model, effectively the company’s white-label version of the more famous GPT-3 AI. Like most state-of-the-art AIs these days, that was trained on a vast corpus of text scraped from the internet in questionable ways, and poured into a datacentre with thousands of expensive chips that turned the text into something approaching coherence. But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it can have a conversation with you. That focus allows it to bring in other expertise, though, and one of Meta’s most significant successes is hooking the language model up to the broader internet. In other words: “BlenderBot 3 is capable of searching the internet to chat about virtually any topic.” On top of that, BlenderBot is designed to improve itself through feedback on earlier conversations, whereas large language models like OPT-175B are generally fairly static.", "However, these models also have serious flaws: they regurgitate biases in their training data and often invent answers to users’ questions (a big problem if they’re going to be useful as digital assistants). This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it’s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it’s worked hard to “minimize the bots’ use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.” Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  “We are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,” Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge.
