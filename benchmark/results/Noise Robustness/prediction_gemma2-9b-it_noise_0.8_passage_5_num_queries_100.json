The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.", "However, the concert tour took place in honor of the 40th anniversary.

The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

There’s something about the open road that just feels healing, and there’s something about a silver screen and popcorn that just feels right.  Now, every so often, something magical happens, and we’re treated to a perfect combination of summer pastimes, culminating in a genre that stands alone: road-trip films.  Stories about cooped-up families, reluctant companions, or cavalcades of muppets seem to resonate with all of us, validating the joys and stresses of our own cross-country adventures – almost as if we’re watching a movie about ourselves. So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.   Alright, so technically, this isn’t a summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s still the all-time best buddy adventure film.

So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey’s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam’s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed “dysfunctional family dramas”.  ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation.

His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching.

And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself.

The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.", "At Super Bowl LV, it was Tom Brady stealing the show yet again, but for the first time in his career, not while wearing a New England Patriots jersey.  Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set. Super Bowl LVIII will be hosted by Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, and Super Bowl LVIX will be at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, home of the Saints.", "Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).  Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in the New York area—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium.", "Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]"], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

And here's what you need to know about it. Former US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, called Truth Social, is now available to download on iOS. So, here's what you need to know about Truth Social, which is already proving to be a controversial social media platform for various reasons. Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President’s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts. Truth Social came about following Trump's bans from various social media platforms---including Facebook and Twitter---in 2021. These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings. So once these mainstream social media platforms dumped him, Trump announced his intention to build his own platform. So, what is Trump’s social network about anyway? Here’s everything you need to know about Truth Social. Truth Social is a social media app founded by former US President Donald Trump and owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). This company was formed in February 2021 with the intention of building alternatives to mainstream media platforms.", "However, the social network delivered early when it comes to the web app at least. No word yet on when Truth Social will submit an Android app so Trump can stop complaining about Google.   More in", "[114] A U.S.-based reporter for the BBC attempted to sign up in early April and was placed on a waitlist with about 1.4 million requests ahead of him.[115]  On April 4, it was reported that Josh Adams and Billy Boozer, the platform's chief of technology and chief of product development respectively, had left the company.[52][17] A report in The Washington Post stated Truth Social was \"falling apart\", with problems mounting on multiple fronts.[116] A Guardian article compared Truth Social with Trump Steaks and Trump Vodka.[17]  As of late April 2022, MarketWatch reported Truth Social had around 513,000 active daily users, compared to Twitter's reported active daily userbase of 217 million.[117]  Usership figures were not available, but Trump was reported on August 19, 2022, to have 3.9 million Truth Social followers. He had had 89 million on Twitter and 34 million on Facebook before being banned from both platforms.[118]  As of early June 2022, SimilarWeb reported Truth Social's iOS app as ranking #49 in the social networking category of apps on the Apple App Store.[119] As of October 2022, the iOS app had sunk to #75 in the social networking category.[120]", "In early March 2022, multiple sources reported that Truth Social usage remained low, with Trump himself not having posted to his account since his first message two weeks earlier and his account having only 140,000 followers—less than 0.2% of the 90 million followers he had on Twitter before his account was banned.[81][108] The Daily Dot reported the Truth Social iOS app had fallen from the number one slot for downloads on the Apple App Store to number 84.[110] The Daily Beast reported Trump was dissatisfied with the social network's progress.[109][68]  At the end of March 2022, TheWrap reported that weekly installations of the Truth Social app had fallen from 872,000 in its launch week to around 60,000 per week, a reduction of over 90%. Visits to truthsocial.com had also fallen, from 6 million per week to 1.9 million. According to Sensor Tower, Truth Social had been downloaded 1.2 million times by late March.[111] In early April 2022, Bloomberg News reported that shares in Truth Social's publicly traded holding company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) had fallen 31% from the time of the app's launch in late February[112] and 64% from its all-time high.[113]  In early April 2022, Business Insider described Truth Social as \"like a conservative ghost town that had been overrun by bots\".", "Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to \"fuck\" him. According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.  Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week. According to a press release from Wednesday, the initial web app rollout was scheduled for some time over the next week or two."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family.", "The 2022 Winter Olympics (2022年冬季奥林匹克运动会), officially called the XXIV Olympic Winter Games (Chinese: 第二十四届冬季奥林匹克运动会; pinyin: Dì Èrshísì Jiè Dōngjì Àolínpǐkè Yùndònghuì) and commonly known as Beijing 2022 (北京2022), was an international winter multi-sport event held from 4 to 20 February 2022 in Beijing, China, and surrounding areas with competition in selected events beginning 2 February 2022.[1] It was the 24th edition of the Winter Olympic Games.  Beijing was selected as host city in 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, marking its second time hosting the Olympics, and the last of three consecutive Olympics hosted in East Asia following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.", "Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved behind closed doors, the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be permitted to attend the Games as spectators.[38][39]  On 23 December 2021, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that they had agreed to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak[40] As part of their latest collective agreement with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break for the Olympics and player participation for the first time since 2014.[41]  On 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the Omicron variant in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public.", "With the COVID-19 pandemic showing few signs of abating, Beijing Olympics officials are working to \"make improvements based on epidemic prevention and control policies,\" said Liu Yumin, head of venue planning and construction for the organizing committee.

Ahead of the game, let’s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes.

There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.", "While the longest Super Bowl commercial in 2023 is still to be determined, there have been very pricey ads over the years.

Super Bowl commercials typically last 30 seconds, just like regular commercials. Some companies push the time down to 15 seconds, or even pay extra money to run a 45- or 60-second ad.

Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung, Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a month later.[16]  In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for Project Iris frustrated employees.", "With the rise of concepts such as the metaverse, consumers are more open to wearing devices such as AR glasses and AR headsets.    Figure 丨 AR glasses can be used for a variety of different occasions (source: Raxium)  However, Charles King believes that Google is not very interested in narrating the meta-universe story. Google's acquisition of Raxium is more about expanding Google's more robust, business-centric AR strategy. Moreover, the acquisition is a wake-up call to its competitors.   MicroLED is a promising emerging technology for displays that are already seen as the best choice for next-generation AR displays due to its greater energy efficiency, availability for bright environments, and vibrant colors.   In the display field, OLED was once seen as the most ideal choice for AR applications due to its high pixel density and the advantage of no backlight. However, the limitation of OLEDs in AR applications is that most AR headset devices are used in sunlit environments. As a result, the low brightness environment required by OLEDs can be an issue.   Guillaume Chansin, head of display research at DSCC, a display research organization, said, \"MicroLEDs can be used in brighter environments than OLEDs, which is especially important for AR smart glasses that need to be used outdoors.", "Augmented Reality, Google", "3][4] In May 2019, Google VR/AR head Clay Bavor told CNET that the company was heavily invested in R&D regarding AR devices,[5] while a February 2020 report from The Information revealed that Google had no plans to develop a new pair of augmented reality (AR) smartglasses as of mid-2019, in part due to the highly publicized failure of Glass.[6] In June 2020, Google acquired North, a manufacturer of smartglasses, to assist in its hardware division's vision of ambient computing.[7]  In August 2021, following the announcement that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones would feature the custom-developed Tensor system-on-chip (SoC), Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh told Business Insider that he believed that Tensor had long-term potential for AR-powered smartglasses,[8] and was echoed by CEO Sundar Pichai in October.[9] In November, a \"Google Labs\" division led by Bavor was created to oversee Google's AR and virtual reality (VR) ventures, unrelated to the defunct service of the same name,[10] while development on an AR operating system began the next month for an unknown \"innovative AR device\", an effort spearheaded by Mark Lucovsky.[11] Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Google was working on a \"new iteration\" of smartglasses as a result of its acquisition of North.", "\"That device is in early planning and may still change significantly,\" the source tells Business Insider. With the demise of Hololens 3, Microsoft has moved away from its own Windows-based mixed reality operating system, which formed the basis of Hololens 1 and 2, the source says. Project Bondi, developed with Samsung, will likely rely on Android, while it is still unclear which operating system will be used for the more distant cloud-streaming headset. However, it will likely be necessary for HoloLens developers to rewrite some or all of their software from scratch, it said. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw would not comment on the rumors. Microsoft's big AR shift The report speaks of a deep technical realignment of Microsoft's mixed reality strategy, which is an apt description if rumors of a move away from Windows and transparent AR optics prove true.

And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads.

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also in the metaverse.", "At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.) These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "The chip performs 660 operations per cycle and thus run up to 230 gigaflops at 350 MHz, Gupta said. AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).", "Did you expect 'Avengers: Endgame' to get so dark?

All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set.

In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]", "On December 31, 2021, the Tianwen-1 orbiter deployed a second deployable camera (TDC-2) into Mars orbit which captured photographs of the Tianwen-1 in orbit to celebrate its achievement of the year[20] and a selfie stick payload was deployed to its working position on orbiter to take images of the orbiter's components and Chinese flag on 30 January 2022 to celebrate the Chinese New Year. In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical Federation.[35][36]  The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter, and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37]  China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the \"Tianwen Series\". \"Tianwen-1\" (Chinese: 天问一号)  is the program's first mission, and subsequent planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means \"questions to heaven\" or \"quest for heavenly truth\", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an ancient Chinese poet.", "The orbiter will image the landing site and determine the conditions on the ground in preparation for the landing.

Microsoft stated that it was designed to be more repairable than other Surface models, with replacement parts (such as batteries, displays, keyboards, and motherboards) to be available through its service partners for on-site repairs.[1][2]  The device uses an Intel Celeron CPU, with configurations using either a Celeron N4020 with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, or the N4120 with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage. It has two USB ports, one of which is USB-C. Unlike other Surface models, the Laptop SE uses a round, non-magnetic power connector.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours.

This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be.

In addition to surveilling the Pioneers, Sensus founder Katherine Son employs Tess to spy on her sister and cofounder. Charismatic younger sister Rachel Son is the public face of the company, but it’s the shadowy eldest, Katherine, who pulls all the strings. As the climate crisis on Earth accelerates and billionaires clamber for Parallaxis I to open, Katherine sends Rachel to the space station with one goal—get it ready, or else. Name a hot-button social issue and it’s likely Rebecca Scherm’s A House Between Earth and the Moon touches on it. This is a Big Ideas book. In addition to climate change, space tourism, and Big Tech, plot points also hinge on deepfakes, cyberbullying, screen addiction, abortion rights, and surveillance. Toggling the perspective between Alex, Tess, Mary Agnes, and Rachel, and from Earth into space, a less-nimble author might’ve wound up with a story spread too thin, told too shallowly.

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès.

Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing of the proposed transaction.

Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, \"The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.\" Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, \"Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world.", "AdvisorsGoldman Sachs & Co.

Elon Musk has taken over Twitter and fired its CEO and other top ... “There has been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I ...", "Musk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.", "120] During its quarterly earnings investor call on July 22, Twitter cited the \"chaos\" caused by the proposal as the primary factor for its decline in revenue.[121] In a letter to McCormick on July 26, Musk's lawyers complained that Twitter had hindered them from commencing the discovery process and requested an October 17 start date,[120] which McCormick granted three days later with a duration of five days.[122]  In a tweet on August 6, Musk challenged Agrawal to a public debate on Twitter's spambot accounts, before polling his followers on whether they believed that less than 5 percent of Twitter accounts were \"fake/spam\".[123] On August 10, Musk sold 7.92 million Tesla shares worth a total of $6.9 billion as backup should he lose the lawsuit, despite previously stating he would no longer sell Tesla stock.[124] The next week, McCormick ordered Twitter to produce documents from Beykpour, which Musk's team had requested along with files from 22 other Twitter employees and 41 \"custodians\".[125] Shortly thereafter, Musk subpoenaed Dorsey.", "It’s not obvious to me how, if he bought Twitter, he would then be better able to get his message out, or better able to tell a story in a way that is good for Tesla and good for his economic interests. But it’s not obvious that it wouldn’t be. And he’s a really smart guy. One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that. It’s not obvious how the company would, but if you’re sitting on top of a thing that can create that much value, surely, if you’re really smart then you can extract some value out of it.", "Oct 27, 2022 ...

Vondrousova held to love to take the first set 6-4 with Jabeur winning just one point in the last four games. After taking a toilet break, Jabeur put an easy backhand volley into the net and sent a down-the-line backhand wide prompting the crowd to voice their encouragement. They were vocal again when another unforced error set up another break point, and a forehand into the net handed Vondrousova the early initiative in the second set. The errors continued to flow thick and fast from Jabeur's racket as Vondrousova moved quickly to 40-0. But then an acute backhand cross-court winner got her and the crowd going, and she eventually broke to level at 1-1. Then it was the left-hander's turn to falter in a topsy-turvy set where both players showed mere flashes of their best form.

With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.", "“I’ve always heard good things about Brent. … Good energy. Cares about the players. And obviously a good track record at Penn State. So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players. Tech’s average recruiting ranking in the past four years is 45th nationally and seventh in the ACC, a tick below NC State and Georgia Tech.", "To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.", "The problem has always been that Virginia Tech’s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let’s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction. As such, Verrilli aims to convince the U.S.", "However, no rules have been revealed yet, so we don’t know what this will look like.” Moreover, Long predicts that stablecoins will be a main focus for regulators, pointing out that Wyoming’s special purpose depository regime falls into this category, alongside The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) regulatory guidance for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins issued by DFS-regulated entities. Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.", "Despite the crypto winter, the conference drew in 17,000 people to discuss the crypto regulatory landscape, Web3 development and the future of digital assets.   “Everything is bigger in Texas” proved to be true during Consensus 2022. The crypto conference took place June 9–12 in Austin, Texas, this year, attracting over 20,000 people from across the globe, despite the 100-degree plus weather. According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.  Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia — the Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. “New York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.” Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices. Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful — a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace — told Cointelegraph that crypto winters allow for building phases to start, which he fully supports. “We are now seeing projects build platforms that are real and empowering.", "© 2023 | Terms & Conditions | Privacy & Cookies Policy"], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Though it will be difficult for them to overtake Tesla sales any time soon, Tesla will witness a reduction in its share across major markets. The reason behind this is the price band in which Tesla operates. It mostly operates in the high-to-premium price band, whereas the traditional OEMs are planning to launch vehicles in the budget segment.

Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator’s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:  “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life’s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves. From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his legacy to this day.

He also fought 11 bouts as an amateur boxer.[3] In 1962, Hatch received a Juris Doctor from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.[3] Hatch has stated that during law school, he and his young family resided in a refurbished chicken coop behind his parents' house.[8][9] Hatch worked as an attorney in Pittsburgh and moved to Utah in 1969, where he continued to practice law.[10]  In 1976, in his first run for public office, Hatch was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Democrat Frank Moss, a three-term incumbent.[11] Hatch criticized Moss's 18-year tenure in the Senate, saying, \"What do you call a Senator who's served in office for 18 years? You call him home.\"[12] Hatch ran on the promise of term limits[13] and argued that many senators, including Moss, had lost touch with their constituents.[14]", "He and his wife, Elaine, were married for more than 60 years and were the proud parents of six children and dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He served as a Bishop and missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Orrin G. Hatch was born on March 22, 1934, in Homestead Park, Pennsylvania—just outside of Pittsburgh. His mother was a homemaker and his father was a union carpenter and plaster lather. In humble circumstances, they raised nine children in the aftermath of the Great Depression.  Hatch’s childhood, though happy, was also marked by poverty and significant hardship. When Hatch was just ten years old, he was deeply impacted by the loss of his older brother, Jesse Hatch, who was killed in action in Europe during World War II. After Jesse’s death, Hatch resolved to live two lives—one for himself and one for his brother.  This resolve drove Hatch to succeed in sports and other extracurricular activities. In high school, he played on the varsity basketball team, fought as an amateur boxer, and served as student body president. He brought his passion for music, athletics, and student government with him to Brigham Young University in 1952. To pay his way through college, Hatch worked as a janitor during the school year and as a journeyman lather in the summers.", "Hatch left office, Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian commendation.

Orrin Grant Hatch was born March 22, 1934, in Pittsburgh. His parents had nine children, two of whom died in infancy. Mr. Hatch’s brother Jesse was killed in World War II when his B-24 bomber went down in enemy action over Europe, a loss that the future senator, 10 years old at the time, said had a lifelong impact on him. His father was a metal lather and union member. The family, as the future senator often recounted, had little money and lived in a “ramshackle house” built by his parents out of recycled lumber, one side adorned by a large sign for Meadow Gold Ice Cream.

Chris Licht came over after stints at CBS where he oversaw the Colbert \"Late Show.\" And he had also been at CBS News, and before that, MSNBC. He's promising in this incarnation at CNN that he's going to make the channel less opinion driven, less perhaps focused on Donald Trump as the one true story that they really rode during the Trump era.

But broadly speaking, Carter said, Licht is “a producer first, not executive, key to making CNN work.”           Read Licht’s full memo below:     To my future colleagues:   The team at WarnerMedia has been kind enough to allow me to send this brief note.   First, I want to say how honored and excited I am about the plan for me to join the CNN team. I’ve watched in awe how you are covering the still-unfolding Ukraine story. It’s a great example of the power and impact of CNN. It also is proof that you know how to excel at your work during times of crisis.   Under normal circumstances, I would join you in person to introduce myself. However, Discovery has not yet combined with WarnerMedia and I still work for CBS. The current plan is for me to wind down at CBS in a couple of weeks and then join you at Hudson Yards in May, assuming the formal merger is complete.

And that could be a great thing for the person who takes up the CNN mantle and for the newsroom.

Licht has said there are lessons for CNN and other leading news organizations to learn about how to cover Trump, who is running for president in 2024, at a time of increased partisanship in media and sluggish ratings across the cable news business, but particularly for CNN.  “I don’t, do not, want someone who’s producing an hour of television on CNN saying, ‘You know what? I could lead with this or I could lead with that. I’m going to lead with that because it’ll get a better number.’ I want people leading and stacking their shows in a way based on journalism and what’s important,” Licht said during a separate interview with the journalist Kara Swisher last week. “Let me worry about the ratings.

The signatures were submitted to the Constitutional Council, which is the sole authority to designate participants.[10]  Following the 2017 presidential election, The Republicans (LR) sent its members a questionnaire on the topic of the \"re-foundation\" of the party; of the 40,000 respondents, 70% voted against an open primary like that which was held in 2016 to determine the party nominee.[11] In a document dated 17 October 2017, the Socialist Party (PS) wrote that the financing of the 2022 presidential campaign was not assured despite \"economic restructuring\" but still planned to spend €12,000,000, the maximum legally permitted before the first round. According to the report, the party's leadership had seriously considered the possibility of not presenting a PS candidate in 2022.[12]", "79][80][81] The projections, based on actual ballot papers, also showed that 28% of registered voters did not show up to the second round,[82] making it the lowest turnout since 1969.[83] Official results showed that the turnout was 71.99%, with over 13 million abstentions in the second round, in addition to over 8.6% of ballots cast being blank or invalid (a marked increase over the first round).[77]  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's first round map  Map of which candidate placed second in every department during the first round  2022 French presidential election's first round in Petite Couronne by commune  Results of the first round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the first round by municipality  First-place candidate by country (Overseas French) during the first round  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's second round map  Results of the second round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the second round by municipality  The New York Times commented that the race was much closer than in 2017, when Macron won 66.1% of the vote to Le Pen's 33.9%, but that Macron's margin was wider than expected prior to the election.[85] Le Pen conceded defeat minutes after the estimated results were released,[83] but still called the outcome a victory for her political movement and for the upcoming parliamentary elections.", "Marine Le Pen, the president of the National Rally (RN), announced on 16 January 2020 that she would be running in the election. She previously ran in the 2012 and 2017 presidential elections as the party's candidate, then called the National Front (FN). She came third in 2012 with 17.9% of the vote in the first round and second in 2017 with 21.3% of the vote in the first round and 33.9% of the vote in the second round. Le Pen was elected to the National Assembly in the 2017 French legislative election.[13]  Jean Lassalle, who ran in the 2017 presidential election under the Résistons! banner, coming in seventh place with 1.2% of the vote, announced that he would run again.[14] In 2020, MP Joachim Son-Forget, a radiologist who was elected to the National Assembly for La République En Marche! (LREM) in 2017, formed a new political party called Valeur Absolue and announced his intention to enter the race for the presidency. He had resigned from the LREM group after posting tweets in 2018 that were deemed sexist; he then joined the UDI and Independents group in 2019 before resigning his membership later that year.[15]", "“This will be my responsibility.” At Le Pen’s election night event, at a Parisian park pavilion, the release of projected results provoked a mix of boos and solemn silence. But the far-right leader remained defiant. She denounced “two weeks of unfair, brutal and violent methods” to prevent her win, and she said that “tonight’s result represents in itself a resounding victory.” Macron vs. Le Pen 2022: What to know about France’s presidential election runoff Sunday’s result marked the far right’s best finish in a French presidential election. It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.", "French polling agencies are projecting that centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron will win France’s presidential runoff Sunday, beating far-right rival Marine Le Pen in a tight race that was clouded by the Ukraine war and saw a surge in support for extremist ideas.

This allows for a closer focus, which is great for close-up shots of small things.  Macro mode lets you get within inches of your subject and keep it in focus, like this Lego car. Last year's 13 Pro had a similar feature, but with the new ultrawide, macro photos have better image quality, especially in medium and low light. Another macro photo from the 14 Pro. The 14 Pro nails the focus on Lego Batman in this macro photo. The telephoto camera is basically identical to the one on last year's 13 Pro, but it gets a lift from the 14 Pro's Photonic Engine. Under good lighting, like in the picture below, the telephoto camera takes good photos. Notice in particular the colors and how the camera handles skin tones. A telephoto shot of folks noshing in a parklet. As with the ultrawide, image quality is a step behind the main camera -- especially in dimmer environments. I took this photo of the Embarcadero's Ferry Building during blue hour, with the 14 Pro's telephoto camera. Below is a Portrait mode picture of Maisie the cat taken indoors with the telephoto camera.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "Impressively, the TrueDepth sensor also retains incredibly precise depth data sensing, despite its much smaller package in the Dynamic Island cutout area.  This is one of the times where Apple glosses over a very significant technological leap that a hugely talented team no doubt worked hard on. The competing Android flagship phones have not followed Apple down the technological path of high-precision, infrared-based Face ID, as it requires large sensors that create screen cutouts.  The ‘notch’ had shrunk in the last generation of iPhones, but this far smaller array retains incredible depth sensing abilities that we haven’t seen another product even approximate. And while shipping a software feat — the dynamic island deserves all the hype it gets — Apple also shipped a significant camera upgrade that every user will notice in day to day usage. Time to break into that large camera bump on the rear of iPhone 14 Pro. The ultra-wide camera, introduced with iPhone 11 in 2019, has long played a background role to the main wide camera due to its smaller sensor and lack of sharpness.  Last year, Apple surprised us by giving the entire ultra-wide package a significant upgrade: a more complex lens design allowed for autofocus and extremely-close focus for macro shots, and a larger sensor collected more light and allowed for far more detailed shots.  We reviewed it as finally growing into its own: a ‘proper’ camera.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro.", "One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an “advanced quad-pixel sensor.” However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up.", "Now it's launched the program, it can tell any court in the land that it is providing every possible tool —  and doing so for a $49/week rental fee, including shipping.\r Only, that isn't $49 per week for however long you need to study the 80+ pages of repair manuals available on the new service site.

For Q3 2022, Apple reported revenue of $83.0 billion and a profit of $19.4 billion. Earnings-per-share hit $1.20 for the quarter.  For Q3 2022, analyst predictions for revenue varied; $79.26B at the low end to $88.41B at the high end. The average across 26 analysts, however, was $82.81 billion.  Apple had not provided any guidance for Q3 2022, citing ongoing supply chain issues and continued disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the company had even warned that supply constraints would cost it somewhere in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue for the quarter.  For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. These numbers were boosted heavily by pandemic-induced spending, driven by strong iPad and Mac revenue growth.

(AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021. Restrictive pandemic lockdowns in China that affected its production and demand there, recession fears, and inflation are leading many consumers to cut back on buying new electronics. This doesn’t seem to have caught Apple by surprise, as it plans to keep iPhone production flat in 2022."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud, while affected by foreign exchange. We’re working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.” In the earnings call, Porat said data centers and hardware were driving up the company’s costs of revenues: “The biggest driver of the year-on-year increase in other cost of revenues does continue to be data centers and other operations. The change really here this quarter in Q3, the second largest driver was hardware.” She noted that the company thought businesses and governments are ‘still in the early days of public cloud adoption.' “We continue to invest accordingly,” she added. “We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability.” Google Cloud regions still waiting to go live include Berlin, Dammam, Doha, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, and Turin.

(AMZN) reported robust growth in earnings and revenue in many quarters over the last two years as customers took increasing advantage of the company's online offerings during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the company's revenue growth now is decelerating dramatically. The causes include a slowing economy and an overbuilt fulfillment network that's squeezing profits. Also, Amazon is being pressured by high inflation and ongoing legal actions by antitrust regulators.   Investors will be watching to see how these factors have impacted Amazon's performance when the company reports earnings on July 28, 2022 for Q2 FY 2022. Analysts predict a sharp drop in earnings per share (EPS) year-over-year (YOY), coupled with the smallest revenue gains in at least 19 quarters.

Instead, Nintendo is bringing the game's release date forward by a couple months. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will now come to Nintendo Switch on July 29, which is earlier than its previously announced September 2022 release window. Nintendo also confirmed that a special edition of the game will be available through the My Nintendo Store. It includes special packaging artwork from Xenoblade artist Masatsugu Saito, as well as a 250-page hardcover art book and a steel case. More details on the limited edition will be announced later.

According to Tetsuya Takahashi, creator of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, the Mechonis sword featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles and the Titan of Uraya featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is what sparked the idea of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Bringing the two worlds together, the broken sword of the Mechonis going through the wounded Titan of Uraya is the visual key of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, indicating war between the two worlds, thus the starting idea for this game.[11] In May 2018, Takahashi pitched Xenoblade Chronicles 3 as a new game concept to Nintendo. The first production group of Monolith Soft, known for their work on the Xenoblade Chronicles series, started development on the game in August 2018 after Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country went gold.[12]"], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Although the Haywood siblings are the film's main characters, in many ways, Ricky “Jupe” Park is the core character of Nope, for his backstory, and the current life that he leads personify the main themes that Nope discusses. “Jupe” Park is a washed-up child star who is desperately clinging to fame and relevance by running a self-exploitative theme park called \"Jupiter's Claim\" based on a film he was in in the 90s. Having resided in the Agua Dulce valley for a while, Jupe has encountered Jean Jacket the UFO, and learned that Jean Jacket likes to eat horses. At his theme park, Jupe runs a live show called “The Starlight Lasso Experience.” During the show, Jupe summons Jean Jacket.

(During the intervening years, Muybridge would stand trial for the murder of his wife’s lover and be acquitted on the grounds that it was justifiable homicide — but let’s leave that for a future Peele film.) By Muybridge’s recollection, the series of photographs that became known as “The Horse in Motion” was first published in 1878. The next year, he would begin holding presentations that put his sequential photographs — or, technically, artistic reproductions of them — in motion, using a device he called the zoopraxiscope, a forerunner of the film projector. And as far as “The Horse in Motion” is concerned, some (though not all) of the stills held at the Library of Congress indicate the names of the riders. But those photographs are not the images shown in “Nope.” The Muybridge works in the movie, with the unnamed rider, are from “Plate Number 626,” part of a later series of locomotion studies that Muybridge began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1884 and published in 1887.", "Professor, Management and Organizational Studies, Huron University College, Western University      Kendra Coulter receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.

But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.", "So while the images in “Nope” aren’t, strictly speaking, the horse ride that gave birth to cinema, the pioneering actor, animal wrangler and stunt man shown in them probably is unknown.

In a film that powerfully explores the ethics of animal actors, for those it depends upon to be erased in this way is strange.

As we filmed, I got to know Jeffrey Wright, and I learned so many things about acting from him that are hard to put into words. I observed him closely, how he prepared for scenes, how he tried to bring out every little emotion. One time he told me to shake my leg during a scene, and it made it so much more intense. Sometimes people mistook Jeffrey for an actual guy in prison, which to me shows how much the outfits matter. That piece of cloth tells people you’re guilty. When we filmed the fight scenes, I had to unlearn some of the things I would normally do in a fight, because the stunt coordinator said certain things look better on camera. A scene from \"O.G.\" with Jeffrey Wright and Theothus Carter.   Those 15 weeks were the greatest experience of my life, save for the birth of my son. Now I sit back and wonder: What if I had gotten this opportunity on the streets, when I was out, at an earlier age? I’m from Haughville, a neighborhood in Indianapolis where the schools never had plays or drama classes. I grew up around drug dealers, hustlers, crooked cops. Both my parents had drug habits.

The allure of fast, easy money has a major pull when you grow up with nothing.  For many years, I thought the street life was the most exciting thing in the world. Until I met Madeleine Sackler. She discovered a talent in me that I didn’t know I possessed. Filmmaking occupied the space in my mind that was previously occupied by the street life; it was a breath of fresh air, and it gave me a sense of hope. That’s especially important in a place where most people lose their purpose for living. Making this movie showed that people are willing to give us a second chance. But you also have to be ready for that second chance, and take nothing for granted. Shortly after we finished filming, my son was killed on the outside. I’ll be dealing with this for the rest of my life. I know he’s smiling down on me, and I want him to know that his mom and I love him and miss him. It’s powerful to know that I was able to do something positive with my life, something he could be proud of me for while he was still alive. I dedicated the role to him.

Kim Jong-hyeok is a North Korean General who meets Carter during his mission, providing him transport out of South Korea. General Kim is played by Lee Sung-jae, a veteran South Korean actor with credits in TV and film. Lee’s most notable credit is Barking Dogs Never Bite, a 2000 dark comedy film that was the directorial debut of Bong Joon-ho, whose film Parasite won the 2020 Oscar for Best Picture.

When Meta announced the project, my eyebrows raised slightly at the sample conversation it had chosen to illustrate the post with – a chat between a user and BlenderBot in which the AI, well, lies. When asked what it’s doing it says “I’ve been working on my new book all night”, and follows up with the claim the book will be its ninth, with previous novels including “a modern retelling of pride and prejudice”. The question of what it means to want an AI to tell the truth is a tricky one. As we saw in June with Google’s LaMDA, the fundamental goal of these models is to provide a user with the appropriate text to finish their prompt: if you ask a machine what it did at the weekend, the machine is probably correct in assuming that you want to engage in light role-play, rather than stick to the facts. Nonetheless, the decision to advertise BlenderBot with a conversation in which it lied to a user is suggestive of the attitude the company is taking with it. The idea is that, by releasing the project as a chatbot on the internet, Meta has more leeway to experiment without risking negative outcomes.", "In just a week of its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its own creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments.

Just a week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.  It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well, yes and no.
