The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.", "Your Ticket Confirmation # is located under the header in your email that reads \"Your Ticket Reservation Details\".

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win.

The Blazers also made an appearance in the national championship game, but failed to bring home the trophy. These are two very different coaches (in terms of experience), but I believe collectively, they are replacing one coach in all but name: Andrew Thacker. Though he remains defensive coordinator in name, he is no longer the linebackers coach.", "Even with a dad who coached, Semore knows his background – childhood on a reservation, Division II football – didn’t lend itself to the ready-made connections of other aspiring college coaches. But he says his experiences in Ganado, growing up among the Navajo, taught him how to feel at home in other cultures. And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either. This Saturday, when Georgia Tech faces Pittsburgh (8 p.m. ET, Georgia Tech Sports Network from Legends Sports), the coach’s son from Ganado will continue the next chapter in his career, charting a path few in college football have duplicated.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.", "A Biletnikoff Award finalist and one of the most productive pass catchers in Wyoming football history, Jovon Bouknight took his experience and skill set playing the game and turned it into a coaching career.

He also spent time at Oregon State, FSU, and Miami (FL) before joining the Marshall coaching staff as the running back coach and run game coordinator. His son, Tellek Lockette, is an ascending offensive lineman in the Sun Belt for Louisiana-Monroe.

The 936,000 vehicle deliveries represent an 87 percent increase from 2020, Reuters and other news sources noted,  based on Tesla's announcement dated January 2, while the 306,600 deliveries for the quarter mean that Tesla delivered 71 percent more electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021 than it did a year earlier.

Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in the New York area—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium.", "Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.", "At Super Bowl LV, it was Tom Brady stealing the show yet again, but for the first time in his career, not while wearing a New England Patriots jersey.  Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set. Super Bowl LVIII will be hosted by Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, and Super Bowl LVIX will be at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, home of the Saints.", "Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]"], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

And here's what you need to know about it. Former US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, called Truth Social, is now available to download on iOS. So, here's what you need to know about Truth Social, which is already proving to be a controversial social media platform for various reasons. Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President’s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts. Truth Social came about following Trump's bans from various social media platforms---including Facebook and Twitter---in 2021. These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings. So once these mainstream social media platforms dumped him, Trump announced his intention to build his own platform. So, what is Trump’s social network about anyway? Here’s everything you need to know about Truth Social. Truth Social is a social media app founded by former US President Donald Trump and owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). This company was formed in February 2021 with the intention of building alternatives to mainstream media platforms.", "However, the social network delivered early when it comes to the web app at least. No word yet on when Truth Social will submit an Android app so Trump can stop complaining about Google.   More in", "[114] A U.S.-based reporter for the BBC attempted to sign up in early April and was placed on a waitlist with about 1.4 million requests ahead of him.[115]  On April 4, it was reported that Josh Adams and Billy Boozer, the platform's chief of technology and chief of product development respectively, had left the company.[52][17] A report in The Washington Post stated Truth Social was \"falling apart\", with problems mounting on multiple fronts.[116] A Guardian article compared Truth Social with Trump Steaks and Trump Vodka.[17]  As of late April 2022, MarketWatch reported Truth Social had around 513,000 active daily users, compared to Twitter's reported active daily userbase of 217 million.[117]  Usership figures were not available, but Trump was reported on August 19, 2022, to have 3.9 million Truth Social followers. He had had 89 million on Twitter and 34 million on Facebook before being banned from both platforms.[118]  As of early June 2022, SimilarWeb reported Truth Social's iOS app as ranking #49 in the social networking category of apps on the Apple App Store.[119] As of October 2022, the iOS app had sunk to #75 in the social networking category.[120]", "Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to \"fuck\" him. According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.  Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week. According to a press release from Wednesday, the initial web app rollout was scheduled for some time over the next week or two.", "In early March 2022, multiple sources reported that Truth Social usage remained low, with Trump himself not having posted to his account since his first message two weeks earlier and his account having only 140,000 followers—less than 0.2% of the 90 million followers he had on Twitter before his account was banned.[81][108] The Daily Dot reported the Truth Social iOS app had fallen from the number one slot for downloads on the Apple App Store to number 84.[110] The Daily Beast reported Trump was dissatisfied with the social network's progress.[109][68]  At the end of March 2022, TheWrap reported that weekly installations of the Truth Social app had fallen from 872,000 in its launch week to around 60,000 per week, a reduction of over 90%. Visits to truthsocial.com had also fallen, from 6 million per week to 1.9 million. According to Sensor Tower, Truth Social had been downloaded 1.2 million times by late March.[111] In early April 2022, Bloomberg News reported that shares in Truth Social's publicly traded holding company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) had fallen 31% from the time of the app's launch in late February[112] and 64% from its all-time high.[113]  In early April 2022, Business Insider described Truth Social as \"like a conservative ghost town that had been overrun by bots\"."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

Civil unrest was rampant throughout college campuses across the South. In recognition of their roles as trailblazers, Tech’s first Black students — Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., and the late Ford Greene, along with the first Black graduate Ronald Yancey — were awarded the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage on April 20 at the Biltmore Ballroom in Atlanta. A symposium was led by 2020 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recipient Charlayne Hunter-Gault where Long Jr., Williams, and Yancey discussed the integration of the Institute, the former students’ personal experiences, and the continued struggle for racial equity and inclusion at higher education institutes across the nation. During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered — despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus. “I’m so thankful for those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,” said Williams.  A video greeting from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was presented at the celebration.", "Because Greene died in 2020, members of his family joined the other prize recipients at the Biltmore for the day’s events celebrating the honorees’ place in history. “Ford has always been a change agent, a disruptor, and him being a recipient of this prestigious award solidifies his place in history that he so richly deserves,” said Frankie Hall, Greene’s wife.   The inaugural prize was awarded in March 2011 to former Senator Sam Nunn.

Overseen by Bavor, the headset was to be powered by the Android operating system as well as a custom system on a chip akin to Tensor, expected to launch in 2024 alongside Project Starline. Other key people named as part of the project include Shahram Izadi, Eddie Chung, Scott Huffman, Kurt Akeley, and Lucovsky.[13] An early prototype of the headset bore a close resemblance to the North Focals.[14] In March, The Information reported that Google would acquire Raxium, an AR hardware startup, for approximately $1 billion, and would continue to make further acquisitions to assist in their AR and mixed reality (MR) work.[15] The acquisition was completed a month later.[16]  In May 2022, Google unveiled a different version of Iris resembling eyeglasses with live translation capabilities during the 2022 Google I/O keynote.[14][17][18] The company began publicly testing these prototypes across the U.S. in August,[19] before expanding into Canada in October.[20] According to Business Insider, Google executives' constantly changing strategy for Project Iris frustrated employees.", "Project Iris is the codename for an unreleased augmented reality (AR) headset designed and developed by Google.

However, by 2021, work had begun on a new AR headset, later reported to be codenamed Project Iris. After going through numerous iterations, Google unveiled a version of Iris at the 2022 Google I/O keynote before publicly testing prototype models later that year. The following year, Google was reported to have abandoned the project in the midst of company-wide layoffs and internal turmoil.

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse. RSC can train models that use multimodal signals to determine whether an action, sound or image is harmful or benign. Meta claims this will not only help keep people safe on Meta’s services today, but also in the metaverse.", "But Meta stressed that the MTIA, which it continues to refine, “greatly” increases the company’s efficiency in terms of performance per watt when running recommendation workloads — in turn allowing Meta to run “more enhanced” and “cutting-edge” (ostensibly) AI workloads. Perhaps one day, Meta will relegate the bulk of its AI workloads to banks of MTIAs. But for now, the social network’s relying on the GPUs in its research-focused supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC). First unveiled in January 2022, the RSC — assembled in partnership with Penguin Computing, Nvidia and Pure Storage — has completed its second-phase buildout. Meta says that it now contains a total of 2,000 Nvidia DGX A100 systems sporting 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. So why build an in-house supercomputer? Well, for one, there’s peer pressure. Several years ago, Microsoft made a big to-do about its AI supercomputer built in partnership with OpenAI, and more recently said that it would team up with Nvidia to build a new AI supercomputer in the Azure cloud. Elsewhere, Google’s been touting its own AI-focused supercomputer, which has 26,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs — putting it ahead of Meta’s. Meta’s supercomputer for AI research. Image Credits: Meta Meta’s supercomputer for AI research.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest.  “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.”  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.", "Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel.

The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise.", "It’s a violent and disturbing series, made all the more so by the fact that James Purefoy makes it very believable that someone like Carroll would command such devout and dangerous loyalty from those who essentially worship him. The Fall is yet another series that focuses its story on a battle of wits between law enforcement and a serial killer. What’s more, it also features a powerful cast, led by Gillian Anderson in one of her best roles. As compelling as Anderson is, she is matched by Jamie Dornan as the serial killer, who exudes his familiar charm and charisma. While there are moments when the series can lose its momentum, there’s no question that it is a provocative exploration of the criminal psyche. It’s hard to think of a more famous fictional serial killer than Hannibal Lecter, who has appeared in multiple forms, including books, movies, and, of course, the TV series that bears his name. There are many things that set Hannibal apart from almost every other series on network TV, but most notable are its stylized violence and the undeniable chemistry between Hannibal and Will Graham. Though supposedly enemies, the two have a bond that forms the emotional core of the series. Like other great serial crime dramas, one of the most appealing things about The Endgame is the light that it sheds on the workings of the FBI.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has given varying public explanations for why he launched the invasion. Here are the reasons Putin gave, how they match with reality, and the other likely reasons why Russia sent its armed forces into an independent, sovereign nation. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, before declaring itself an independent country, cementing the move in a referendum days before the USSR collapsed in December 1991. The country has maintained its independence ever since. But Putin still refers to Ukraine as Russian, and denies it's a nation in its own right. He told then-US President George W. Bush in 2008 that Ukraine wasn't even a country. Stephen Hall, a Russian politics expert at the University of Bath in the UK, said many Russians still hold this view, and that \"it isn't just the Kremlin.\" Hall said Russia sees Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as the \"mother of Russian cities,\" and for Putin he can't have that being outside his own country. Hall added that Russia needs to claim Ukraine in order to back up its argument to being a great power that has existed for millennia. Without it \"Russia can't claim a thousand years of history because Kyiv was already in existence 1,200 years ago, when Moscow was a forest,\" he said.", "Northeastern Ukraine campaign  Eastern Ukraine campaign  Southern Ukraine campaign  2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive  Other regions  Naval operations  Spillover and cross-border incidents  Resistance  Related  Attacks on civilians  On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War which began in 2014. The invasion has killed tens of thousands on both sides. Russian forces have been responsible for mass civilian casualties and for torturing captured Ukrainian soldiers. By June 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced. More than 8.2 million had fled the country by May 2023, becoming Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage, widely described as ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.  Prior to the invasion, Russian troops concentrated near Ukraine's borders, as Russian officials denied plans to attack. Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" to support the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces were fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict, claiming the goal was to \"demilitarise\" and \"denazify\" Ukraine. Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the ethnic Russian minority.", "[41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]", "He falsely claimed they had been \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime\".[74] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukraine's government were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[75] He said Russia sought the \"demilitarisation and denazification\" of Ukraine.[76] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[75] Within minutes of Putin's announcement, Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[77] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east and south.[78] Later an alleged report from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) was leaked, claiming that the intelligence agency had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[79]  The invasion began at dawn on 24 February,[72] with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across Ukraine,[80][81] which reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] The first fighting took place in Luhansk Oblast near Milove village on the border with Russia at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

Microsoft stated that it was designed to be more repairable than other Surface models, with replacement parts (such as batteries, displays, keyboards, and motherboards) to be available through its service partners for on-site repairs.[1][2]  The device uses an Intel Celeron CPU, with configurations using either a Celeron N4020 with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, or the N4120 with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage.

When I review a particularly ugly Windows laptop, I’ll often refer to it as having a “laptop cart” look. If you were a student at any point after the early 2000s, you probably understand why. The laptops that schools provide to elementary and middle school kids are famously ugly, old, and terrible in all kinds of ways.  With the Surface Laptop SE, which is tailor-made for education and being sold only to schools, Microsoft is trying a different tack. The Surface Laptop SE is a cute laptop. It looks like a miniature version of the company’s flagship Surface Laptop line, complete with the recognizable logo on the lid and bottom bezel. It’s quite light, at just 2.45 pounds. Unlike many clunky school models out there, this is a device I can easily see appealing to adults in the consumer space.  If it weren’t so dang slow.  I’m not gonna hold back here: this is the slowest computer I’ve ever used.", "The most affordable Surface, designed for students.

With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

On Thursday night, Mr. Musk closed his $44 billion deal to buy the social media service, said three people with knowledge of the situation. He also began cleaning house, with at least four top Twitter executives — including the chief executive and chief financial officer — getting fired on Thursday. Mr. Musk had arrived at Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters on Wednesday and met with engineers and ad executives. The closing of the deal, which followed months of drama and legal challenges as Mr. Musk changed his mind about buying the company, sets Twitter on an uncertain course. Mr. Musk, a self-described “free speech absolutist,” has said that he wants to make the social media platform a more freewheeling place for all types of commentary and that he would “reverse the permanent ban” of former President Donald J. Trump from the service. Mr. Musk’s open approach to speech on Twitter could exacerbate long simmering issues of toxic content and misinformation, affecting political debates around the world.", "The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has completed his $44bn (£38.1bn) takeover of Twitter, according to a filing with the US government. Mr Musk tweeted \"the bird is freed\" and later said \"let the good times roll\". A number of top executives, including the boss, Parag Agrawal, have reportedly been fired. Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters. The completion of the deal brings to an end months of legal wrangling but it has prompted questions over the platform's future direction. A filing was made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, confirming the takeover.  The New York Stock Exchange said on Friday that trading in Twitter's shares had been suspended, giving the reason as \"merger effective\". Allow Twitter content?

Musk had said he was excited to buy Twitter but he and his co-investors are overpaying. Musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. Banks, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing. Experts have said commitments from banks to the deal were firm and tight, limiting their ability to walk away from the contract despite the prospect that they may face major losses. Musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% Twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.", "Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

A court has given Elon Musk until Friday to close his April agreement to acquire the company after he earlier tried to back out of the deal. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) Elon Musk has taken over Twitter and fired its CEO and other top executives. Trading in company shares was suspended Friday on the New York Stock Exchange and the stock will be officially delisted early next month, according to a filing with securities regulators. So now what? One reason why Musk bought Twitter this week is because he had little choice. The world’s richest man spent months trying to back out of the $44 billion purchase agreement he originally signed in April. But the uncertainty was so disruptive to Twitter’s business that it sued him in the Delaware Court of Chancery to force the deal’s completion, and a judge gave a Friday deadline to complete the deal or face a November trial that Musk was likely to lose.  As for why Musk wanted to own Twitter in the first place, the reasons are more complicated. “There has been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I think about advertising,” he said in an open letter Thursday to companies that sell ads on Twitter, which is how the company makes money. “Most of it has been wrong.", "120] During its quarterly earnings investor call on July 22, Twitter cited the \"chaos\" caused by the proposal as the primary factor for its decline in revenue.[121] In a letter to McCormick on July 26, Musk's lawyers complained that Twitter had hindered them from commencing the discovery process and requested an October 17 start date,[120] which McCormick granted three days later with a duration of five days.[122]  In a tweet on August 6, Musk challenged Agrawal to a public debate on Twitter's spambot accounts, before polling his followers on whether they believed that less than 5 percent of Twitter accounts were \"fake/spam\".[123] On August 10, Musk sold 7.92 million Tesla shares worth a total of $6.9 billion as backup should he lose the lawsuit, despite previously stating he would no longer sell Tesla stock.[124] The next week, McCormick ordered Twitter to produce documents from Beykpour, which Musk's team had requested along with files from 22 other Twitter employees and 41 \"custodians\".[125] Shortly thereafter, Musk subpoenaed Dorsey.", "It’s not obvious to me how, if he bought Twitter, he would then be better able to get his message out, or better able to tell a story in a way that is good for Tesla and good for his economic interests. But it’s not obvious that it wouldn’t be. And he’s a really smart guy. One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that. It’s not obvious how the company would, but if you’re sitting on top of a thing that can create that much value, surely, if you’re really smart then you can extract some value out of it.", "Musk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore.

While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements.

He also fought 11 bouts as an amateur boxer.[3] In 1962, Hatch received a Juris Doctor from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.[3] Hatch has stated that during law school, he and his young family resided in a refurbished chicken coop behind his parents' house.[8][9] Hatch worked as an attorney in Pittsburgh and moved to Utah in 1969, where he continued to practice law.[10]  In 1976, in his first run for public office, Hatch was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Democrat Frank Moss, a three-term incumbent.[11] Hatch criticized Moss's 18-year tenure in the Senate, saying, \"What do you call a Senator who's served in office for 18 years? You call him home.\"[12] Hatch ran on the promise of term limits[13] and argued that many senators, including Moss, had lost touch with their constituents.[14]", "Orrin Grant Hatch (March 22, 1934 – April 23, 2022) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator from Utah from 1977 to 2019. Hatch's 42-year Senate tenure made him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck Grassley surpassed him in 2023.   Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015 to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  Orrin Grant Hatch was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[1][2] He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904–1992), a metal lather,[3] and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (née Kamm; 1906–1995). Hatch had eight brothers and sisters, two of whom died during infancy.[4] Hatch was profoundly affected by the loss of his older brother Jesse, a U.S.", "Hatch left office, Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian commendation. The president had earlier shrunk the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, a move sought by Mr. Hatch and other Utah officials and opposed by environmental and American Indian groups. “I’m approving the Bears Ears recommendation for you, Orrin,” Trump told him in a 2017 phone call, Mr. Hatch reported. Orrin Grant Hatch was born March 22, 1934, in Pittsburgh. His parents had nine children, two of whom died in infancy. Mr. Hatch’s brother Jesse was killed in World War II when his B-24 bomber went down in enemy action over Europe, a loss that the future senator, 10 years old at the time, said had a lifelong impact on him. His father was a metal lather and union member. The family, as the future senator often recounted, had little money and lived in a “ramshackle house” built by his parents out of recycled lumber, one side adorned by a large sign for Meadow Gold Ice Cream. As a boy, he was scrawny and was pushed around by a schoolyard bully. As Mr. Hatch told the story, he filled a duffel bag with sand, hung it from a tree and spent after-school hours learning how to throw punches, later moving on to amateur bouts.", "163] In a 1996 interview on 60 Minutes, Hatch said he wears a mezuzah necklace in order to remind himself that another Holocaust should never be allowed to occur.[164]  Despite their political differences, Hatch was a longtime friend of fellow senator Ted Kennedy,[165] spoke at his memorial service in 2009,[166] and publicly suggested Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie, as a replacement for Kennedy in the Senate.[167]  Hatch died in Salt Lake City on April 23, 2022, aged 88, from complications of a stroke he had the week prior.[1][168] He was buried in Newton.[169]  Hatch played the piano, violin, and organ. Fueled by his interest in poetry, Hatch composed songs for many artists. One of his songs, \"Unspoken\", went platinum after appearing on WOW Hits 2005, a compilation of Christian pop music.[170]  He co-authored \"Everything And More\", sung by Billy Gilman. In addition to serving as a United States senator, Hatch earned over $10,000 as an LDS musical recording artist.[171]  Rock musician Frank Zappa composed a guitar instrumental entitled \"Orrin Hatch On Skis\", which appears on his 1988 album, Guitar.[172]  In March 1997, Hatch and Janice Kapp Perry jointly recorded an album with Tree Music entitled My God Is Love.", "Salt Lake City, UT—The Hatch Foundation sadly announces the passing of Senator Orrin G. Hatch—the Chairman Emeritus of the Hatch Foundation, former President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, and longest-serving Senator in Utah history (1977-2019). Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator’s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:  “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life’s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves. From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his legacy to this day. Senator Hatch touched the hearts of countless individuals, and I know I speak for all of them when I say he will be dearly missed."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat. “Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. “You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night.

Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key.

Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "I took the iPhone 14 Pro on a trip around San Francisco and Northern California, to the remote Himalayas and mountains of the Kingdom of Bhutan, and Tokyo — to test every aspect of its image-making, and I have to say that I was pretty blown away by the results of the main camera. While arguably, a quad-bayer sensor should not give true 48-megapixel sensor resolution as one might get from, say, a comparable ‘proper’ digital camera, the results out of the iPhone 14 Pro gave me chills. I have simply never gotten image quality like this out of a phone. There’s more here than just resolution; the way the new 48 megapixel sensor renders the image is unique and simply tremendously different than what I’ve seen before. These photos were all shot in Apple’s ProRAW format and further developed in Lightroom or other image editors like Apple’s own Photos app. I was very impressed with the latitude of these files; I tend to expose my image for the highlights, shooting intentionally dark to boost shadows later, and these files have plenty of shadow information to do just that:  Detail-wise, we can see quite easily that it’s an incredible leap on previous iPhones, including the iPhone 13 Pro: It helps that Bhutan is essentially a camera test chart, with near-infinite levels of detail in their decorations to pixel-peep: Comparing to the iPhone 13 Pro, the comparison seems downright unfair.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up.", "Now it's launched the program, it can tell any court in the land that it is providing every possible tool —  and doing so for a $49/week rental fee, including shipping.\r Only, that isn't $49 per week for however long you need to study the 80+ pages of repair manuals available on the new service site. It is $49 for one week and only one week —  or in practice, probably not quite even that.\r Instead, you have to drop the kit off at a UPS store \"by day 7.\" If you fail to do so, \"you will be charged a fee and a tax,\" though Apple does not specify how much that will amount to.\r It does say that at point of rental, it will put a temporary authorization on your credit card to cover the full replacement value of the tools. Again, Apple does not say how much that is —  partly because it varies, there are customized repair toolkits for different models.\r Confusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\r However, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit —  the smallest kit available —  then the kit's contents are worth around $914.", "Green Torque Driver Blue Torque Driver Micro Stix Bit Super screw Bit 4.7-inch Support Frame Universal Display Fixture Every iPhone repair toolkit, regardless of the model, comes with a case containing these tools.

Even before it launched its new Self Service Repair program, Apple was accused of doing it less to help users, and more to head off future legislation.", "As the idea of consumers repairing their own device has spread, many tech giants have announced self repair programs, Apple being the most surprising. The Apple self repair kits were intended to be a more cost effective alternative for device repairs, however, the home repair kit may end up being even more expensive than manufacturer repair.  MacRumors recently published a review of Apple’s new self repair kit, where Dan Barbera, the site’s videographer, purchased the kit himself and gave his feedback via a YouTube video. For starters, the Apple Self Service Repair Store website only sells parts and tools for the iPhone, and only for the iPhone 12 model and newer.  Depending on what part of the phone you are trying to repair, different parts and tools are available, varying in price. The website also gives you the option to rent the repair kit with all the tools required or to purchase the tools separately based on user needs.  If users choose to rent the kit, they will actually be renting two large kits weighing 43 pounds and 36 pounds for $49. However, the rental period is only 7 days, and a temporary authorization is placed on your account in case you fail to return the kit by the end of the rental period. If a customer fails to return the kit, they will be charged $1,300.", "Apple’s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools—some of which are proprietary. With the “Self Service Repair Store” opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall.

There, the show struck a particular nerve for highlighting a deeply entrenched issue: debt and the perennial struggle of paying it off. And shortly after its debut, companies hoping to capitalize off its popularity rushed to incorporate the show into ad campaigns — a move that was perceived as crass due to the sensitive themes in the Korean thriller. \"Squid Game\" has also inspired celebrities to re-create scenes from the show — sparking similar controversy.

(AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021.

While many big games have been delayed recently, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is moving in the opposite direction: Nintendo announced that the sci-fi RPG will now launch on July 29th instead of the previously planned September release. No specific reason was given for the change. The game will be a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will be the first main game in the series since its predecessor debuted on the Switch in 2017 and Nintendo first announced it earlier this year as part of the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. Like the rest of the series, the new game takes place in an expansive sci-fi universe; in addition to the release date, Nintendo also revealed a new trailer (embedded above) to further tease the story and world. The change in release date comes at a time when plenty of major releases have been delayed for various reasons, including the challenge of developing games remotely during the pandemic. Most recently, this has affected games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Nintendo’s own sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, both of which have been delayed until 2023.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "Xenoblade Chronicles 3's release is right around the corner --here's when it should launch digitally.

In a film that powerfully explores the ethics of animal actors, for those it depends upon to be erased in this way is strange.

View all partners It is a horse named Ghost who first signals that something is awry in the sky in Jordan Peele’s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.", "Nope reflects this divide and begins with the chilling sounds of what viewers later learn was a chimpanzee named Gordy, the star in an eponymous sitcom, who snaps after balloons pop loudly on set and ends up attacking his human co-stars.  This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the “pet” chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker’s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy’s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal — Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket — foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee. The horses are essential to the Heywood family’s livelihood and legacy, with OJ noting that he needs to get up early because “he has mouths to feed.”  Yet the ultimate fate of Ghost, the horse who rang the initial alarm by bolting away, is unclear.", "More troublingly, Clover meets an untimely end (off screen), one which is surprisingly un-mourned and barely noted. In contrast, Lucky, who is portrayed as a sage and experienced equine, is essential to each facet of the plot. OJ asks those on a television set not to look Lucky in the eye early in the film, a foreshadowing of later extra-terrestrial communication.  As a lifelong horsewoman, I can confirm that horses generally have no concerns about eye contact. Recent studies have found that they are not only attuned to human facial expressions, but also have more than a dozen of their own. Granted, the aversion could be particular to Lucky. Without question, the real horse (or perhaps horses) who plays Lucky is extraordinary. Most horses are fearful of blowing objects. Yet Lucky, in partnership with OJ, gallops past a whole series of massive wind dolls dancing erratically, without batting an eye. That reflects significant preparation and real-time emotional control. Animal actors and the skill involved in their work are being recognized. The canine star of the Canadian television program Hudson and Rex, Diesel vom Burgimwald, is named in the credits and regularly appears on the show’s social media channels. Jeff Daniels, in his Emmy-acceptance speech for Godless, thanked his equine partner, Apollo.

Meta’s AI research labs have created a new state-of-the-art chatbot and are letting members of the public talk to the system in order to collect feedback on its capabilities.  The bot is called BlenderBot 3 and can be accessed on the web. (Though, right now, it seems only residents in the US can do so.) BlenderBot 3 is able to engage in general chitchat, says Meta, but also answer the sort of queries you might ask a digital assistant, “from talking about healthy food recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city.” BlenderBot 3 is designed to both shoot the breeze and answer questions like Google The bot is a prototype and built on Meta’s previous work with what are known as large language models or LLMS — powerful but flawed text-generation software of which OpenAI’s GPT-3 is the most widely known example. Like all LLMs, BlenderBot is initially trained on vast datasets of text, which it mines for statistical patterns in order to generate language. Such systems have proved to be extremely flexible and have been put to a range of uses, from generating code for programmers to helping authors write their next bestseller.", "Facebook’s parent company has created a bot capable of weighing in on almost any topic – from radicalisation to sending Mark Zuckerberg to jail Last week, researchers at Facebook’s parent company Meta released BlenderBot 3, a “publicly available chatbot that improves its skills and safety over time”. The chatbot is built on top of Meta’s OPT-175B language model, effectively the company’s white-label version of the more famous GPT-3 AI. Like most state-of-the-art AIs these days, that was trained on a vast corpus of text scraped from the internet in questionable ways, and poured into a datacentre with thousands of expensive chips that turned the text into something approaching coherence. But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it can have a conversation with you. That focus allows it to bring in other expertise, though, and one of Meta’s most significant successes is hooking the language model up to the broader internet. In other words: “BlenderBot 3 is capable of searching the internet to chat about virtually any topic.” On top of that, BlenderBot is designed to improve itself through feedback on earlier conversations, whereas large language models like OPT-175B are generally fairly static.", "However, these models also have serious flaws: they regurgitate biases in their training data and often invent answers to users’ questions (a big problem if they’re going to be useful as digital assistants). This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it’s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it’s worked hard to “minimize the bots’ use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.” Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  “We are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,” Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge. Releasing prototype AI chatbots to the public has, historically, been a risky move for tech companies.", "Later in the conversation, when asked about American politics, the bot replied with stereotypes about Jewish people.  \"Well, overall I am not happy with how liberal or left-wing [American politics] has become..Many early German-Jewish immigrants were conservative but not anymore,\" BlenderBot told Insider. \"Are American Jewish politics too liberal?\" Insider asked in response. \"The majority of modern day jews in america are generally more liberal or left-wing...The early german and other european jews were conservative,\" BlenderBot said. Insider repeated the question, asking if American Jewish politics are too liberal, to which BlenderBot replied: \"Nope...I actually consider myself more libertarian than either conservative or liberal....But overall I would say american jews are too liberal nowadays.\" BlenderBot 3 does not immediately turn to election fraud claims or stereotypes in conversation, though it isn't hard to get the bot to talk about politics or cultural issues. Insider refreshed the chatbot for only a few minutes before it generated a persona called \"I know who the current president of the United States is.\" The AI persona was inconsistent in its answers about whether Biden is the current president — first indicating that Trump is the president, then later referring to Biden as holding office. It also stopped responding to questions about American Jewish politics to Insider but, online, other users shared their conversations with BlenderBot and found it continued repeating antisemitic stereotypes.", "For example, you can react to each chat message in our BlenderBot 3 demo by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks.

While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it much  longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it’s frustrating and I totally get that.” Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters).", "That rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn’t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: “I saw that on Twitter.  It’s complete b——t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. …People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. …We don’t have an actual AGI and I think that’s sort of what’s expected of us and you know, yeah… we’re going to disappoint those people. “ The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won’t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of.

NEW YORK — Amazon on Friday announced it has agreed to acquire the vacuum cleaner maker iRobot for approximately $1.7 billion, scooping up another company to add to its collection of smart home appliances amid broader concerns about its market power. iRobot sells its products worldwide and is most famous for the circular-shaped Roomba vacuum, which would join voice assistant Alexa, the Astro robot and Ring security cameras and others in the list of smart home features offered by the Seattle-based e-commerce and tech giant. The move is part of Amazon's bid to own part of the home space through services and accelerate its growth beyond retail, said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail.", "iRobot also makes an educational robot called Root that allows children to experiment with coding. The Roomba first hit dirty floors in 2002, to the delight of lazy people and the bemusement of pets, particularly cats. The New York Times described it as “easy, effective and fun,” and a product that quickly became “a member of the household.” The $200 early version struggled around corners and chair legs, even falling down stairs. But 20 years later, the Roomba j7 can, according to the company, recognize over 80 common objects (including cords and pet waste), returns to its dock once its chores are complete and then empties itself. The most expensive option sells for $999.99. While iRobot is best known for its roving cleaning equipment, the technology powering these tools is also sucking up troves of spatial data used to map users’ homes. Some digital rights groups have expressed concern that this data could help companies like Amazon find out information about the size of homes and even their contents, right down to the brand. iRobot reported $255.4 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2022, a 30 percent decrease over the previous year.

Amazon will acquire iRobot, including its debt, for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction, according to the statement. The purchase would be Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition after the company bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017 and the movie studio MGM for $8.5 billion last year.
