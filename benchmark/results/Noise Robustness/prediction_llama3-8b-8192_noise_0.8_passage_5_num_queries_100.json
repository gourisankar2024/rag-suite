The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey.

There’s something about the open road that just feels healing, and there’s something about a silver screen and popcorn that just feels right.  Now, every so often, something magical happens, and we’re treated to a perfect combination of summer pastimes, culminating in a genre that stands alone: road-trip films.  Stories about cooped-up families, reluctant companions, or cavalcades of muppets seem to resonate with all of us, validating the joys and stresses of our own cross-country adventures – almost as if we’re watching a movie about ourselves. So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.   Alright, so technically, this isn’t a summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s still the all-time best buddy adventure film.

Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. — He’s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "2006 | Round Valley (AZ) High School (Defensive Coordinator) 2007 | Colorado School of Mines (Secondary Coach) 2008 - 2009 | Adams State (Co-Defensive Coordinator/Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator) 2010 - 2011 | Tulsa (Outside Linebackers Coach) 2012 - 2013 | Oklahoma State (Defensive Assistant) 2014 | Colorado School of Mines (Defensive Coordinator) 2015 | Montana (Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator) 2016 - 2017 | Montana (Defensive Coordinator) 2018 | Temple (Senior Defensive Advisor) 2019 - 2020 | Georgia Tech (Defensive Analyst) 2021 | Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator) Semore actually has more experience than I remember seeing, but this is still the highest level position he has held and is sure to bring plenty of challenge.  At Valdosta State, Semores defense ranked top 20 nationally in defensive touchdowns, pass defense, redzone defense, and fumble recoveries. The Blazers also made an appearance in the national championship game, but failed to bring home the trophy. These are two very different coaches (in terms of experience), but I believe collectively, they are replacing one coach in all but name: Andrew Thacker. Though he remains defensive coordinator in name, he is no longer the linebackers coach.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.", "Even with a dad who coached, Semore knows his background – childhood on a reservation, Division II football – didn’t lend itself to the ready-made connections of other aspiring college coaches. But he says his experiences in Ganado, growing up among the Navajo, taught him how to feel at home in other cultures. And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either. This Saturday, when Georgia Tech faces Pittsburgh (8 p.m. ET, Georgia Tech Sports Network from Legends Sports), the coach’s son from Ganado will continue the next chapter in his career, charting a path few in college football have duplicated."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.", "At Super Bowl LV, it was Tom Brady stealing the show yet again, but for the first time in his career, not while wearing a New England Patriots jersey.  Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set. Super Bowl LVIII will be hosted by Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, and Super Bowl LVIX will be at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, home of the Saints.", "Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]", "Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).  Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in the New York area—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Visits to truthsocial.com had also fallen, from 6 million per week to 1.9 million. According to Sensor Tower, Truth Social had been downloaded 1.2 million times by late March.[111] In early April 2022, Bloomberg News reported that shares in Truth Social's publicly traded holding company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) had fallen 31% from the time of the app's launch in late February[112] and 64% from its all-time high.[113]  In early April 2022, Business Insider described Truth Social as \"like a conservative ghost town that had been overrun by bots\".", "Donald Trump's much-anticipated social media platform, called Truth Social, has debuted on iOS.

So, here's what you need to know about Truth Social, which is already proving to be a controversial social media platform for various reasons. Former US President Donald Trump's social media app, Truth Social, is now available to download from Apple's App Store. It was launched on February 21st, 2022, which is President’s Day in the US. Immediately upon launching, the app reached the number one spot on the App Store's Top Charts. Truth Social came about following Trump's bans from various social media platforms---including Facebook and Twitter---in 2021. These platforms removed Trump due to concerns around his public comments following the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021. Before getting himself banned from various social media platforms, Trump built up huge followings. So once these mainstream social media platforms dumped him, Trump announced his intention to build his own platform. So, what is Trump’s social network about anyway? Here’s everything you need to know about Truth Social. Truth Social is a social media app founded by former US President Donald Trump and owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). This company was formed in February 2021 with the intention of building alternatives to mainstream media platforms.", "[114] A U.S.-based reporter for the BBC attempted to sign up in early April and was placed on a waitlist with about 1.4 million requests ahead of him.[115]  On April 4, it was reported that Josh Adams and Billy Boozer, the platform's chief of technology and chief of product development respectively, had left the company.[52][17] A report in The Washington Post stated Truth Social was \"falling apart\", with problems mounting on multiple fronts.[116] A Guardian article compared Truth Social with Trump Steaks and Trump Vodka.[17]  As of late April 2022, MarketWatch reported Truth Social had around 513,000 active daily users, compared to Twitter's reported active daily userbase of 217 million.[117]  Usership figures were not available, but Trump was reported on August 19, 2022, to have 3.9 million Truth Social followers. He had had 89 million on Twitter and 34 million on Facebook before being banned from both platforms.[118]  As of early June 2022, SimilarWeb reported Truth Social's iOS app as ranking #49 in the social networking category of apps on the Apple App Store.[119] As of October 2022, the iOS app had sunk to #75 in the social networking category.[120]", "Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to \"fuck\" him. According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.  Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week.

With the demise of Hololens 3, Microsoft has moved away from its own Windows-based mixed reality operating system, which formed the basis of Hololens 1 and 2, the source says. Project Bondi, developed with Samsung, will likely rely on Android, while it is still unclear which operating system will be used for the more distant cloud-streaming headset. However, it will likely be necessary for HoloLens developers to rewrite some or all of their software from scratch, it said. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw would not comment on the rumors. Microsoft's big AR shift The report speaks of a deep technical realignment of Microsoft's mixed reality strategy, which is an apt description if rumors of a move away from Windows and transparent AR optics prove true. Microsoft would thus make a radical U-turn away from Hololens 1 and 2, whose development started almost ten years ago. According to the report, the first AR glasses Microsoft developed under the codename \"Fortaleza\" reportedly had a puck-shaped feed, like Magic Leap's device.

Moreover, the acquisition is a wake-up call to its competitors.   MicroLED is a promising emerging technology for displays that are already seen as the best choice for next-generation AR displays due to its greater energy efficiency, availability for bright environments, and vibrant colors.   In the display field, OLED was once seen as the most ideal choice for AR applications due to its high pixel density and the advantage of no backlight. However, the limitation of OLEDs in AR applications is that most AR headset devices are used in sunlit environments. As a result, the low brightness environment required by OLEDs can be an issue.   Guillaume Chansin, head of display research at DSCC, a display research organization, said, \"MicroLEDs can be used in brighter environments than OLEDs, which is especially important for AR smart glasses that need to be used outdoors.", "12]  In January 2022, The Verge reported that Google was building an AR headset which used \"outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world\", internally codenamed Project Iris and being developed in a highly secretive and secure facility located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel. An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta An AI chip Meta custom-designed for AI workloads. Image Credits: Meta “To gain better levels of efficiency and performance across our important workloads, we needed a tailored solution that’s co-designed with the model, software stack and the system hardware,” Bjorlin continued. “This provides a better experience for our users across a variety of services.” Custom AI chips are increasingly the name of the game among the Big Tech players.", "The chip performs 660 operations per cycle and thus run up to 230 gigaflops at 350 MHz, Gupta said. AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).", "7] The series premiered on February 21, 2022.[2] On May 12, 2022, NBC canceled the series after one season.[3]  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 33% approval rating based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10.

In September 2022, the mission was awarded the World Space Award by the International Astronautical Federation.[35][36]  The Tianwen-1 mission was the second of three Martian exploration missions launched during the July 2020 window, after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency's Hope orbiter, and before NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which landed the Perseverance rover with the attached Ingenuity helicopter drone.[37]  China's planetary exploration program is officially dubbed the \"Tianwen Series\". \"Tianwen-1\" (Chinese: 天问一号)  is the program's first mission, and subsequent planetary missions will be numbered sequentially.[38] The name Tianwen means \"questions to heaven\" or \"quest for heavenly truth\", from the same classical poem written by Qu Yuan (c. 340–278 BC), an ancient Chinese poet.", "39][40] Tianwen-1's rover is named Zhurong (Chinese: 祝融号), after a Chinese mytho-historical figure usually associated with fire and light.[41] The name was chosen through an online poll held from January to February 2021.[42]  China's Mars program started in partnership with Russia. In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]", "The orbiter will image the landing site and determine the conditions on the ground in preparation for the landing.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

In general, there was strong condemnation of Smith's violence and support for Rock, though some defended Smith's actions or refused to side solely with either man.", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally.

Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.", "[14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and video.[29][30]  On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table.

Smith: Yes.  Rock: It was a G.I. Jane joke.  Smith: [voice rising] Keep my wife's name... out your fucking mouth!  Rock: I'm going to, okay? Oh, I could, oh, okay. That was a... greatest night in the history of television, okay. [audience laughs] Okay—[15] This exchange caused the local audience and journalists to realize that Smith's reaction was genuine.[14][16] Kevin Costner, who waited offstage to present the Academy Award for Best Director, said, \"Oh, that was real.\"[13] Until Smith's acceptance speech, the reportedly stunned and confused audience expected any official acknowledgement from the stage, and those in the mezzanine level occasionally stood to peer over the balcony to seek action below. However, the show did not use hosts from this point and continued as normal.[14] Smith's expletives were censored by audio muting during the live broadcast in many countries.[14][17][18][19]  Photo-journalist Brian Snyder, working for Reuters in the photographer pool in the projection booth, photographed Smith striking Rock.[20] This photo quickly went viral, was featured in news stories, and was adapted into Internet memes.[16] He was unaware of the photo's cultural impact until after the ceremony, as his photos were automatically sent to his editors."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film The Fabulous Baron Munchausen combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac.[citation needed]", ") Mary Agnes worries that her schlubby dad will be changed by the posh Parallaxis I she sees in promotional videos, but her fear is misplaced.

The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.", "Oct 27, 2022 ...

But it’s not obvious that it wouldn’t be. And he’s a really smart guy. One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that. It’s not obvious how the company would, but if you’re sitting on top of a thing that can create that much value, surely, if you’re really smart then you can extract some value out of it."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Following the match, King greeted Vondrousova with a hug and told her: “First unseeded ever.

Vondroušová became the first unseeded female player to win the Wimbledon title, the first to contest the final since Billie Jean King did so in 1963,[3] and at world No. 42 was the second-lowest-ranked finalist since the WTA rankings were established in 1975.[4] By winning the title, Vondroušová made her debut in the top ten of the WTA rankings.

Vondrousova held to love to take the first set 6-4 with Jabeur winning just one point in the last four games. After taking a toilet break, Jabeur put an easy backhand volley into the net and sent a down-the-line backhand wide prompting the crowd to voice their encouragement. They were vocal again when another unforced error set up another break point, and a forehand into the net handed Vondrousova the early initiative in the second set. The errors continued to flow thick and fast from Jabeur's racket as Vondrousova moved quickly to 40-0. But then an acute backhand cross-court winner got her and the crowd going, and she eventually broke to level at 1-1. Then it was the left-hander's turn to falter in a topsy-turvy set where both players showed mere flashes of their best form. But Jabeur, from 3-1 up, again lost her way with Vondrousova levelling at 3-3 before breaking again for a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve for the match.", "Vondrousova joked that his tears of joy at match’s end were the most emotion he’s shown in the eight years they’ve been together; their first wedding anniversary is Sunday.

So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players. Tech’s average recruiting ranking in the past four years is 45th nationally and seventh in the ACC, a tick below NC State and Georgia Tech.", "To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal.

Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta).

Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.", "Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told Cointelegraph that he thinks the bipartisan bill is “terrific,” further noting that the bill contains modest differences in how stablecoins are treated compared with his stablecoin approach, which was drafted in April this year. Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction.

According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.  Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia — the Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. “New York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.” Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices.

Those fuel tanks were emptying far faster than anticipated. At that half-mile mark, Rich Strike was ahead of only two horses. He was sitting in 18th place.

Even more, the company’s operating expenses only ticked up 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, giving the EV company a huge jump in its operating margin — that figure rose from 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, to 14.7% in the final quarter of 2021, to 19.2% in its most recent three-month period.

Though it will be difficult for them to overtake Tesla sales any time soon, Tesla will witness a reduction in its share across major markets. The reason behind this is the price band in which Tesla operates. It mostly operates in the high-to-premium price band, whereas the traditional OEMs are planning to launch vehicles in the budget segment.

Upon the Senator’s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:  “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life’s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves.

Orrin Grant Hatch was born in 1934 in Pittsburgh. He married Elaine Hanson in 1957 and graduated from Brigham Young University in 1959. He received a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1962 and was a partner in the law firm of Thomson, Rhodes and Grigsby in that city until 1969.

You call him home.\"[12] Hatch ran on the promise of term limits[13] and argued that many senators, including Moss, had lost touch with their constituents.[14]", "He and his wife, Elaine, were married for more than 60 years and were the proud parents of six children and dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

In humble circumstances, they raised nine children in the aftermath of the Great Depression.  Hatch’s childhood, though happy, was also marked by poverty and significant hardship. When Hatch was just ten years old, he was deeply impacted by the loss of his older brother, Jesse Hatch, who was killed in action in Europe during World War II. After Jesse’s death, Hatch resolved to live two lives—one for himself and one for his brother.  This resolve drove Hatch to succeed in sports and other extracurricular activities. In high school, he played on the varsity basketball team, fought as an amateur boxer, and served as student body president. He brought his passion for music, athletics, and student government with him to Brigham Young University in 1952. To pay his way through college, Hatch worked as a janitor during the school year and as a journeyman lather in the summers."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

I could lead with this or I could lead with that. I’m going to lead with that because it’ll get a better number.’ I want people leading and stacking their shows in a way based on journalism and what’s important,” Licht said during a separate interview with the journalist Kara Swisher last week. “Let me worry about the ratings.

The signatures were submitted to the Constitutional Council, which is the sole authority to designate participants.[10]  Following the 2017 presidential election, The Republicans (LR) sent its members a questionnaire on the topic of the \"re-foundation\" of the party; of the 40,000 respondents, 70% voted against an open primary like that which was held in 2016 to determine the party nominee.[11] In a document dated 17 October 2017, the Socialist Party (PS) wrote that the financing of the 2022 presidential campaign was not assured despite \"economic restructuring\" but still planned to spend €12,000,000, the maximum legally permitted before the first round.

It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.", "French polling agencies are projecting that centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron will win France’s presidential runoff Sunday, beating far-right rival Marine Le Pen in a tight race that was clouded by the Ukraine war and saw a surge in support for extremist ideas.

This is one of the times where Apple glosses over a very significant technological leap that a hugely talented team no doubt worked hard on. The competing Android flagship phones have not followed Apple down the technological path of high-precision, infrared-based Face ID, as it requires large sensors that create screen cutouts.  The ‘notch’ had shrunk in the last generation of iPhones, but this far smaller array retains incredible depth sensing abilities that we haven’t seen another product even approximate. And while shipping a software feat — the dynamic island deserves all the hype it gets — Apple also shipped a significant camera upgrade that every user will notice in day to day usage. Time to break into that large camera bump on the rear of iPhone 14 Pro. The ultra-wide camera, introduced with iPhone 11 in 2019, has long played a background role to the main wide camera due to its smaller sensor and lack of sharpness.  Last year, Apple surprised us by giving the entire ultra-wide package a significant upgrade: a more complex lens design allowed for autofocus and extremely-close focus for macro shots, and a larger sensor collected more light and allowed for far more detailed shots.  We reviewed it as finally growing into its own: a ‘proper’ camera.", "When you try to take a photo with the main camera and are standing very close to a subject, the iPhone 14 Pro switches to the ultrawide camera and crops the framing to mimic the main camera. This allows for a closer focus, which is great for close-up shots of small things.  Macro mode lets you get within inches of your subject and keep it in focus, like this Lego car. Last year's 13 Pro had a similar feature, but with the new ultrawide, macro photos have better image quality, especially in medium and low light. Another macro photo from the 14 Pro. The 14 Pro nails the focus on Lego Batman in this macro photo. The telephoto camera is basically identical to the one on last year's 13 Pro, but it gets a lift from the 14 Pro's Photonic Engine. Under good lighting, like in the picture below, the telephoto camera takes good photos. Notice in particular the colors and how the camera handles skin tones. A telephoto shot of folks noshing in a parklet. As with the ultrawide, image quality is a step behind the main camera -- especially in dimmer environments. I took this photo of the Embarcadero's Ferry Building during blue hour, with the 14 Pro's telephoto camera. Below is a Portrait mode picture of Maisie the cat taken indoors with the telephoto camera.", "One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an “advanced quad-pixel sensor.” However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases — 79 pounds of tools — on my front porch. I couldn’t believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple’s paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started.

We've received your submission.\t Can a “Squid Game” reality series turn around Netflix’s fading fortunes? The embattled streamer has announced they’re creating a real-life version of the gory South Korean survival show — with production slated to take place in the UK early next year.  “Squid Game: The Challenge” is being billed as “the biggest reality competition series ever created” and will feature 456 contestants battling it out for a whopping $4.56 million in prize money.  According to a press release put out by Netflix on Tuesday, the staggering sum will be the largest cash prize ever offered on reality television.  “‘Squid Game’ took the world by storm with [director] Hwang Dong-hyuk’s captivating story and iconic imagery,” Netflix VP Brandon Rieg said in the release. “We’re grateful for his support as we turn the fictional world into reality in this massive competition and social experiment.” Casting is currently open to English-language speakers over the age of 21 at SquidGameCasting.com. The reality show will feature 10 episodes and production is expected to take place over four weeks.

When the nine-episode thriller premiered on Sept. 21, \"Squid Game\" notched the No. 1 spot in 94 countries, including its home base, South Korea. There, the show struck a particular nerve for highlighting a deeply entrenched issue: debt and the perennial struggle of paying it off. And shortly after its debut, companies hoping to capitalize off its popularity rushed to incorporate the show into ad campaigns — a move that was perceived as crass due to the sensitive themes in the Korean thriller. \"Squid Game\" has also inspired celebrities to re-create scenes from the show — sparking similar controversy. In November, Chrissy Teigen was reprimanded for hosting a \"Squid Game\"-themed party with celebrity guests dressed as players from the smash hit.", "The games in the forthcoming reality series are set to be inspired by the games in the show, however they won’t be quite as gruesome.  “The stakes are high, but in this game the worst fate is going home empty-handed,” Tuesday’s press release read. “Squid Game” is the most successful Netflix series in history, watched by more than 142 million households during the first four weeks of its launch.

Netflix is hoping the forthcoming reality show spin-off will keep fans forking out for their monthly subscription as the streamer falls on hard times.  Back in April, Netflix confirmed it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, falling well short of its forecast of adding 2.5 million subscribers.

For comparison’s sake, in the same quarter a year ago, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30.

According to Tetsuya Takahashi, creator of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, the Mechonis sword featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles and the Titan of Uraya featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is what sparked the idea of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Bringing the two worlds together, the broken sword of the Mechonis going through the wounded Titan of Uraya is the visual key of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, indicating war between the two worlds, thus the starting idea for this game.[11] In May 2018, Takahashi pitched Xenoblade Chronicles 3 as a new game concept to Nintendo. The first production group of Monolith Soft, known for their work on the Xenoblade Chronicles series, started development on the game in August 2018 after Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country went gold.[12]", "Xenoblade Chronicles 3 arrives on July 29, which is a little earlier than expected. By      Eddie Makuch    on April 19, 2022 at 6:26AM PDT Nintendo has announced a new release date for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but unlike The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, this is not a delay. Instead, Nintendo is bringing the game's release date forward by a couple months. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will now come to Nintendo Switch on July 29, which is earlier than its previously announced September 2022 release window. Nintendo also confirmed that a special edition of the game will be available through the My Nintendo Store. It includes special packaging artwork from Xenoblade artist Masatsugu Saito, as well as a 250-page hardcover art book and a steel case. More details on the limited edition will be announced later. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was announced during the February 2022 Nintendo Direct. The game features a brand-new cast of characters, including the dual protagonists Noah and Mio. Players can control Noah's party of six, in addition to other characters on the way. A new trailer sets up some of the backstory for the game, which is set in the world of Aionios, a \"vast and sublime natural world.\" The video also spotlights some of the game's battle system.", "Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was received positively by critics, who praised its story, themes, gameplay, music, characters, and scale, but criticized its technical and graphical issues at launch. The game had sold 1.86 million copies by March 2023. An expansion taking place before the events of the game, Future Redeemed, was released in April 2023.  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an action role-playing game with a large open world. Unlike previous Xenoblade games, the game allows for up to seven party members to participate in battles at once, including the main party of six and an additional \"Hero\" character. Up to 19 Heroes can be recruited to the party through story events or sidequests, each with different skills and abilities. Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use. Like the previous entries, the game has an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that affects in-game events, such as the availability of quests and items.

View all partners It is a horse named Ghost who first signals that something is awry in the sky in Jordan Peele’s latest visually and thematically ambitious film Nope. OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.", "With this shot they plan to kill two birds with one stone: they can show the world the creature that has been tormenting them, and they can sell the extraordinary footage for millions of dollars. Before this, OJ was trying to accrue some money by selling horses to his neighbor, Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun), who lives in the same Agua Dulce valley, just down the road from the Haywoods. Although the Haywood siblings are the film's main characters, in many ways, Ricky “Jupe” Park is the core character of Nope, for his backstory, and the current life that he leads personify the main themes that Nope discusses. “Jupe” Park is a washed-up child star who is desperately clinging to fame and relevance by running a self-exploitative theme park called \"Jupiter's Claim\" based on a film he was in in the 90s. Having resided in the Agua Dulce valley for a while, Jupe has encountered Jean Jacket the UFO, and learned that Jean Jacket likes to eat horses. At his theme park, Jupe runs a live show called “The Starlight Lasso Experience.” During the show, Jupe summons Jean Jacket. To do this, he buys horses from the Haywood ranch, and unbeknownst to the Haywoods, Jupe uses them as sacrificial bait for Jean Jacket to come down and eat the horses in front of a live audience.", "The head horse wrangler — Bobby Lovgren — is named, but the horses are omitted. In a film that powerfully explores the ethics of animal actors, for those it depends upon to be erased in this way is strange.

He sits alongside the many other male athletes, women mimicking housework and children in Muybridge’s oeuvre: an anonymous cast of characters from early film history.", "on the farm of the state’s former governor (and future senator and university founder) Leland Stanford, Muybridge conducted further experiments, developing a system in which carefully arrayed cameras were connected to wires that a horse’s travels along a track could trip. (During the intervening years, Muybridge would stand trial for the murder of his wife’s lover and be acquitted on the grounds that it was justifiable homicide — but let’s leave that for a future Peele film.) By Muybridge’s recollection, the series of photographs that became known as “The Horse in Motion” was first published in 1878. The next year, he would begin holding presentations that put his sequential photographs — or, technically, artistic reproductions of them — in motion, using a device he called the zoopraxiscope, a forerunner of the film projector. And as far as “The Horse in Motion” is concerned, some (though not all) of the stills held at the Library of Congress indicate the names of the riders. But those photographs are not the images shown in “Nope.” The Muybridge works in the movie, with the unnamed rider, are from “Plate Number 626,” part of a later series of locomotion studies that Muybridge began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1884 and published in 1887."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

When Meta announced the project, my eyebrows raised slightly at the sample conversation it had chosen to illustrate the post with – a chat between a user and BlenderBot in which the AI, well, lies. When asked what it’s doing it says “I’ve been working on my new book all night”, and follows up with the claim the book will be its ninth, with previous novels including “a modern retelling of pride and prejudice”. The question of what it means to want an AI to tell the truth is a tricky one. As we saw in June with Google’s LaMDA, the fundamental goal of these models is to provide a user with the appropriate text to finish their prompt: if you ask a machine what it did at the weekend, the machine is probably correct in assuming that you want to engage in light role-play, rather than stick to the facts. Nonetheless, the decision to advertise BlenderBot with a conversation in which it lied to a user is suggestive of the attitude the company is taking with it. The idea is that, by releasing the project as a chatbot on the internet, Meta has more leeway to experiment without risking negative outcomes.", "Last year a former employee, Frances Haugen, accused the company of putting profits ahead of online safety.  The company owns some of the largest social media companies and messaging apps in the world, including Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.  BlenderBot 3's algorithm searches the internet to inform its answers. It is likely its views on Mr Zuckerberg have been \"learnt' from other people's opinions that the algorithm has analysed.  The Wall Street Journal has reported BlenderBot 3 told one of its journalists that Donald Trump was, and will always be, the US president.  A business Insider journalist said the chatbot called Mr Zuckerberg \"creepy\".  Meta has made the BlenderBot 3 public, and risked bad publicity, for a reason. It needs data.  \"Allowing an AI system to interact with people in the real world leads to longer, more diverse conversations, as well as more varied feedback,\" Meta said in a blog post.  Chatbots that learn from interactions with people can learn from their good and bad behaviour. In 2016 Microsoft apologised after Twitter users taught its chatbot to be racist. Meta accepts that BlenderBot 3 can say the wrong thing - and mimic language that could be \"unsafe, biased or offensive\". The company said it had installed safeguards, however, the chatbot could still be rude. When I asked the BlenderBot 3 what it thought about me, it said it had never heard of me.", "In just a week of its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its own creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments.  The third iteration of Meta’s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company’s answer to Google’s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.  It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.", "However, LaMDA, the other advanced conversational AI by the search giant, was mired in controversy when the company tried to suppress the fact that LaMDA believes it is a person and wants to be respected. Blake Lemoine, the Google techie tasked with determining if LaMDA had racist or hateful tendencies in its conversational responses, blew the whistle and was ultimately suspended by Google. South Korean startup Scatter Lab’s Luda chatbot also turned racist and responded with anti-LGBTQ remarks and was temporarily shut down last year.
