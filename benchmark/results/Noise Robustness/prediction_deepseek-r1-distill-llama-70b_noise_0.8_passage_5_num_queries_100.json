The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie.

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

I remember that sometimes bowl games have different names due to sponsorship changes.

Let me start by going through the document provided to see if it mentions his role there.\n\nLooking at the document, I see a section that lists his coaching stops and positions. It says: \"2021 | Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator)\". That seems pretty clear. So, in 2021, he was the Defensive Coordinator at Valdosta State. Then, the next line mentions he went to Georgia Tech as a defensive analyst in 2019-2020, but wait, that's before Valdosta State. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the document says: \"2019 - 2020 | Georgia Tech (Defensive Analyst)\" and then \"2021 | Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator)\". So, he was at Georgia Tech before Valdosta State. But the question is about his position at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech. Wait, does he return to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State? Or was he at Georgia Tech before Valdosta State?\n\nLooking again, the document lists his positions in order: after 2018 at Temple, he was at Georgia Tech in 2019-2020 as a defensive analyst, then at Valdosta State in 2021 as defensive coordinator. So, he was at Valdosta State after Georgia Tech. The question is asking what position he held at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech, but according to the document, he went from Georgia Tech to Valdosta State, not the other way around.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the timeline. Let me list out his positions in order:\n\n- 2006: Round Valley High School (Defensive Coordinator)\n- 2007: Colorado School of Mines (Secondary Coach)\n- 2008-2009: Adams State (Co-Defensive Coordinator/Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator)\n- 2010-2011: Tulsa (Outside Linebackers Coach)\n- 2012-2013: Oklahoma State (Defensive Assistant)\n- 2014: Colorado School of Mines (Defensive Coordinator)\n- 2015: Montana (Secondary Coach/Special Teams Coordinator)\n- 2016-2017: Montana (Defensive Coordinator)\n- 2018: Temple (Senior Defensive Advisor)\n- 2019-2020: Georgia Tech (Defensive Analyst)\n- 2021: Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator)\n\nSo, he was at Georgia Tech in 2019-2020, then at Valdosta State in 2021. Therefore, he didn't return to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State; instead, he went from Georgia Tech to Valdosta State. The question is asking about his position at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech, but according to the document, he didn't return to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State. \n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Perhaps it's asking what position he held at Valdosta State before moving to Georgia Tech. But according to the document, he was at Georgia Tech before Valdosta State. So, perhaps the question has a mistake in the timeline. Alternatively, maybe the document is saying he was at Valdosta State and then went back to Georgia Tech, but that's not indicated here.\n\nWait, the document mentions that at Valdosta State, he was the Defensive Coordinator in 2021. Then, in the next paragraph, it says he's now the linebackers coach at Georgia Tech. So, after Valdosta State in 2021, he went to Georgia Tech. Therefore, before going to Georgia Tech, he was at Valdosta State as Defensive Coordinator.\n\nSo, the question is asking: What position did Jason Semore hold at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech? Since he was at Valdosta State in 2021 and then went to Georgia Tech, his position at Valdosta State was Defensive Coordinator.\n\nWait, but in the document, it says he was at Georgia Tech in 2019-2020, then at Valdosta State in 2021. So, he was at Valdosta State after Georgia Tech, not before. Therefore, he didn't return to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State because he was already at Georgia Tech before that. So, perhaps the question is incorrect in its assumption that he returned to Georgia Tech after Valdosta State. \n\nBut according to the document, after Valdosta State in 2021, he went to Georgia Tech as the linebackers coach. Wait, no, the document says he's currently at Georgia Tech as the linebackers coach, but the timeline shows he was at Valdosta State in 2021, and before that, he was at Georgia Tech in 2019-2020. So, perhaps he was at Valdosta State in 2021, and then in 2022 or later, he went back to Georgia Tech. But the document doesn't specify the exact years beyond 2021. \n\nWait, the document ends with his position at Valdosta State in 2021 and then mentions he's now at Georgia Tech as linebackers coach. So, the progression is:\n\n- 2019-2020: Georgia Tech (Defensive Analyst)\n- 2021: Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator)\n- Then, he moved to Georgia Tech as linebackers coach.\n\nSo, before returning to Georgia Tech, he was at Valdosta State as Defensive Coordinator.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that he was the Defensive Coordinator at Valdosta State before moving to Georgia Tech.\n</think>\n\nJason Semore held the position of Defensive Coordinator at Valdosta State before moving to Georgia Tech as the linebackers coach. \n\nAnswer: Jason Semore was the Defensive Coordinator at Valdosta State before returning to Georgia Tech.", "docs": ["A Biletnikoff Award finalist and one of the most productive pass catchers in Wyoming football history, Jovon Bouknight took his experience and skill set playing the game and turned it into a coaching career.

He also spent time at Oregon State, FSU, and Miami (FL) before joining the Marshall coaching staff as the running back coach and run game coordinator. His son, Tellek Lockette, is an ascending offensive lineman in the Sun Belt for Louisiana-Monroe. A long-time member of the Marshall coaching staff who is on his third stint with the team, Shannon Morrison serves as the LB coach while also being the assistant head coach.

At Valdosta State, Semores defense ranked top 20 nationally in defensive touchdowns, pass defense, redzone defense, and fumble recoveries. The Blazers also made an appearance in the national championship game, but failed to bring home the trophy. These are two very different coaches (in terms of experience), but I believe collectively, they are replacing one coach in all but name: Andrew Thacker. Though he remains defensive coordinator in name, he is no longer the linebackers coach.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.", "Jason Semore is a former Ganado High School football player who now is a linebackers coach at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. — He’s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "Even with a dad who coached, Semore knows his background – childhood on a reservation, Division II football – didn’t lend itself to the ready-made connections of other aspiring college coaches. But he says his experiences in Ganado, growing up among the Navajo, taught him how to feel at home in other cultures. And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either. This Saturday, when Georgia Tech faces Pittsburgh (8 p.m. ET, Georgia Tech Sports Network from Legends Sports), the coach’s son from Ganado will continue the next chapter in his career, charting a path few in college football have duplicated."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H.

This company was formed in February 2021 with the intention of building alternatives to mainstream media platforms.", "Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to \"fuck\" him. According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot.

The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application.

Let me go through the document step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mentions of Super Bowl 2022 specifically. Scanning through the document, I see a section that mentions the prices for recent years. It says, \"In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021.\" That seems pretty straightforward.\n\nI should cross-check this information with other parts of the document to ensure consistency. Earlier, it mentions that in 2021, the cost was $5.5 million, which aligns with the increase noted for 2022. Also, in 2023, the price went up to $7 million, which follows the trend of increasing costs each year.\n\nThere's another part of the document that talks about the cost in 2023 being a record high, which makes sense as each subsequent year's price is higher. Additionally, the document mentions that in 2020, the price was $5.6 million, so the $6.5 million for 2022 fits the pattern of a steady increase.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the document regarding the 2022 price.

Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads.

Yes, the document states that the A15 in the iPhone 14 has an extra GPU core compared to the regular iPhone 13 and the iPhone SE. So, it's a bit more powerful but still the same generation as the A15.\n\nThen, the document contrasts this with the iPhone 14 Pro, which uses the A16 processor. The A16 is described as more power-efficient, especially for intensive tasks, even though the specs like CPU and GPU cores are similar to the A15. Apple says the A16 has better cores, but the key point is that the standard iPhone 14 didn't get this new chip.\n\nI also notice that this is the first time since the iPhone 3G in 2008 that a flagship iPhone didn't receive a new processor. The document explains that this decision was predicted by analysts and might be due to the chip shortage, making it practical to use existing, reliable chips to meet demand.\n\nSo, putting this together, the iPhone 14 uses the A15 Bionic chip, which is an upgraded version from the iPhone 13 but not the latest A16 found in the Pro models. This makes sense as a strategic move by Apple to manage supply and differentiate their Pro line.\n</think>\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are equipped with the A15 Bionic chip, which includes an extra GPU core compared to the version in the iPhone 13, enhancing its performance. This decision by Apple to use the A15 instead of a new chip was influenced by factors like chip shortages and supply chain considerations.", "docs": ["By  Mitchell Clark Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won’t be getting a new processor this year — instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple’s A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that’s in the iPhone 13 Pro — though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone. The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one. Analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and reporters like Mark Gurman have been predicting the move for months, and the chip shortage isn’t quite over yet. Using tried and true chips that Apple’s manufacturer already has experience making could help ensure that there are enough processors to meet demand.", "Year introduced: 2022 Capacity: 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB Colors: Midnight, starlight, (PRODUCT)RED, blue, purple, yellow Model numbers: A2649 (United States, Puerto Rico), A2881 (Canada, Guam, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and U.S. Virgin Islands), A2884 (China mainland, Hong Kong, Macao), A2883 (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia), A2882 (other countries and regions) Details: The iPhone 14 has a 6.1 inch1 all-screen Super Retina XDR display.

Unlike most other computing devices, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is designed to be fully accessible for onsite repairs of common components, so students likely won’t have to wait to get back to work if their SE breaks. With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school. Microsoft has revolutionized that process with the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE.", "8GB or 16GB DDR4 RAM  Processor  Surface Laptop 3 13.5”\r \t\t\tQuad-core 10th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-1035G7 Processor\r \t\t\tQuad-core 10th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1065G7 Processor Surface Laptop 3 15”\r \t\t\tAMD Ryzen™ 5 3580U Mobile Processor with Radeon™ Vega 9 Graphics Microsoft Surface® Edition\r \t\t\tAMD Ryzen™ 7 3780U Mobile Processor with Radeon™ RX Vega 11 Graphics Microsoft Surface® Edition  Security  Firmware TPM\r \t\t\tEnterprise-grade protection with Windows Hello face sign-in  Software  Windows 10 Home 4\r \t\t\tMicrosoft 365 30-day trial  Sensors  Ambient light sensor  What’s in the box  Surface Laptop 3\r \t\t\tPower Supply\r \t\t\tQuick Start Guide\r \t\t\tSafety and warranty documents  Best-in-class support from Microsoft Store  60-day return policy\r \t\t\t90 days of free technical phone support\r \t\t\t12 months in-store support and technical assistance\r \t\t\t1 free training session to transfer data and optimize performance  Storage 3  Removable solid-state drive (SSD)5 options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB  Battery Life1  Surface Laptop 3 13.5”\r \t\t\tUp to 11.", "No offers found When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

This film directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, from a story by Seth Gordon, features Loretta Sage, a brilliant author who writes romance novels set in exotic locations featuring Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest, Dash McMahon. But Loretta's real life bears no resemblance to the things she writes: after her husband's death, she became a reclusive, grumpy woman who is not even eager to write anymore. Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book. Fortunately, Loretta won't be alone: Alan, the cover model of her books, sets out on a journey to rescue her and demonstrate that he can also be a hero.

I remember hearing something about a slap, but I'm not entirely sure of the details. Let me go through the document provided to piece together the events.\n\nFirst, the document mentions that during the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, Will Smith walked onstage and slapped Chris Rock. The reason for the slap was a joke Rock made about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, specifically about her shaved head due to alopecia areata. After slapping Rock, Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity, which was censored in many live broadcasts. Rock continued with his presentation, but the incident overshadowed the rest of the ceremony, including Questlove's win for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nLater that evening, Smith won the Best Actor award and gave a speech where he apologized to the Academy and the nominees but not to Rock. The next day, he apologized to Rock and the Academy via social media. There were consequences for Smith: he resigned from the Academy and was banned from attending their events for ten years.\n\nThe document also talks about the aftermath, including reactions from celebrities, some supporting Rock and others defending Smith. There were conflicting reports on whether Smith was asked to leave the ceremony but refused. Additionally, the incident went viral on social media, with photos and videos being widely shared and turned into memes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key points are: the slap by Smith on Rock, the reason being a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, the immediate reactions, Smith's subsequent actions and apologies, the consequences he faced, and the significant media attention the incident received.\n</think>\n\nAt the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock during the ceremony. The incident occurred when Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia areata, referencing her shaved head. Smith slapped Rock on stage, returned to his seat, and shouted profanity, which was censored in live broadcasts. Despite the incident, Rock continued his presentation. Later, Smith won the Best Actor award and apologized to the Academy and nominees but not to Rock in his speech. The next day, Smith issued a public apology to Rock via social media. \n\nFollowing the incident, Smith faced consequences: he resigned from the Academy and was banned from attending Academy events for ten years.

The incident garnered significant media attention, with photos and videos going viral and becoming memes. Celebrity reactions varied, with some condemning Smith's actions and others defending him.", "docs": ["Musician Questlove and film producers David Dinerstein, Robert Fyvolent, and Joseph Patel were on stage immediately after the incident to accept the Best Documentary Feature award for Summer of Soul, and some commenters opined that this award had been overshadowed by the incident.[77][78][79] The distracted audience searched Twitter for information on Rock and Smith.[14] Gabrielle Ulubay of Marie Claire wrote that Summer of Soul \"deserved to have its moment, and Questlove's touching speech and tribute to his parents deserved to have our full attention—but instead, the world kept its mind on Will Smith and Chris Rock and its eyes on Twitter\".[80]  Questlove was asked about the incident by a reporter in a backstage press conference immediately after leaving the stage, and declined: \"I'm not talking about that tonight, this is about the Harlem Cultural Festival.\"[81] In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next night, Questlove said he did not notice the slap in the moment because he was using Transcendental Meditation to curb his anxiety before the winner was called, and did not realize what had happened until \"maybe three seconds before I spoke words\".[82][83]  Reactions from celebrity attendees at the Academy Awards varied.

The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show.", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally. Also that Wednesday, the Academy issued a statement saying that Smith was asked to leave the Oscars ceremony Sunday night and declined to do so. “Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated,” the statement said. “While we would like to clarify that Mr.", "Rock: Wow, dude!

However, the show did not use hosts from this point and continued as normal.[14] Smith's expletives were censored by audio muting during the live broadcast in many countries.[14][17][18][19]  Photo-journalist Brian Snyder, working for Reuters in the photographer pool in the projection booth, photographed Smith striking Rock.[20] This photo quickly went viral, was featured in news stories, and was adapted into Internet memes.[16] He was unaware of the photo's cultural impact until after the ceremony, as his photos were automatically sent to his editors.", "[14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and video.[29][30]  On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table. This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number.

One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that.

Again, not the winner but some notable achievements.\n\nLooking further down, there's a detailed section about the 2022 Australian Open Men's Singles final. It says the final was between Rafael Nadal (6th seed) and Daniil Medvedev (2nd seed). The match was significant because Nadal was aiming for a record 21st major title, while Medvedev wanted to win his first two majors back-to-back. The result was Nadal defeating Medvedev in a five-set match: 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5.

The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.", "To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta).

Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared.

While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements.

Friday’s transaction puts STX in a position to further develop, market and distribute content globally through multiple distribution channels including theatrical releases, international and direct-to-streaming services, as well as video-on-demand. STX is pivoting away from what originally was conceived as 12 theatrical releases annually. The studio now is planning 15 films a year, with five destined for the big screen and the balance split between straight-to-streaming or international theatrically distributed PVOD or direct-to-streaming titles. Like other studios, STX pivoted during the pandemic, with either hybrid theatrical releases or licensing lucratively straight to streaming. STX sent Greenland to PVOD stateside, skipped theatrical (when New York and Los Angeles cinemas were closed) and sold streaming to HBO Max on that Gerard Butler movie in summer 2020. It licensed what was to be a theatrical release, My Spy, to Amazon. It did handle The Mauritanian, which won a Golden Globe.

We are also happy to exclusively partner with The Forest Road Company on this new and multi-faceted endeavor given their expertise and partnership approach.”", "By   \tBrent Lang  Executive Editor The troubled marriage between STX Entertainment and Eros is dissolving. The Najafi Companies announced Tuesday that it has reached an agreement to acquire the studio behind “Bad Moms” and “Hustlers” from Eros STX Global Corporation. The transaction is expected to close by the end of January 2022. As part of the deal, an affiliate of Najafi will acquire STX Entertainment through the purchase of all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Najafi has partnered with The Forest Road Company. Shares of ErosSTX were trading at less than 40 cents. The company has been threatened with delisting because of its depressed share price. STX had previously tried and abandoned an effort to go public on the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2018, citing unfavorable market conditions. In 2020, it merged with Eros, an Indian media company. STX was formed with the goal of making mid-budget films such as comedies and dramas that major studios had abandoned in favor of comic book adaptations and franchises, but it struggled to field many breakout hits.

He also fought 11 bouts as an amateur boxer.[3] In 1962, Hatch received a Juris Doctor from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.[3] Hatch has stated that during law school, he and his young family resided in a refurbished chicken coop behind his parents' house.[8][9] Hatch worked as an attorney in Pittsburgh and moved to Utah in 1969, where he continued to practice law.[10]  In 1976, in his first run for public office, Hatch was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Democrat Frank Moss, a three-term incumbent.[11] Hatch criticized Moss's 18-year tenure in the Senate, saying, \"What do you call a Senator who's served in office for 18 years? You call him home.\"[12] Hatch ran on the promise of term limits[13] and argued that many senators, including Moss, had lost touch with their constituents.[14]", "Orrin Grant Hatch (March 22, 1934 – April 23, 2022) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator from Utah from 1977 to 2019. Hatch's 42-year Senate tenure made him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck Grassley surpassed him in 2023.   Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015 to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  Orrin Grant Hatch was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[1][2] He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904–1992), a metal lather,[3] and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (née Kamm; 1906–1995). Hatch had eight brothers and sisters, two of whom died during infancy.[4] Hatch was profoundly affected by the loss of his older brother Jesse, a U.S.", "Salt Lake City, UT—The Hatch Foundation sadly announces the passing of Senator Orrin G. Hatch—the Chairman Emeritus of the Hatch Foundation, former President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, and longest-serving Senator in Utah history (1977-2019). Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator’s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:  “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life’s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves. From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his legacy to this day. Senator Hatch touched the hearts of countless individuals, and I know I speak for all of them when I say he will be dearly missed.", "163] In a 1996 interview on 60 Minutes, Hatch said he wears a mezuzah necklace in order to remind himself that another Holocaust should never be allowed to occur.[164]  Despite their political differences, Hatch was a longtime friend of fellow senator Ted Kennedy,[165] spoke at his memorial service in 2009,[166] and publicly suggested Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie, as a replacement for Kennedy in the Senate.[167]  Hatch died in Salt Lake City on April 23, 2022, aged 88, from complications of a stroke he had the week prior.[1][168] He was buried in Newton.[169]  Hatch played the piano, violin, and organ. Fueled by his interest in poetry, Hatch composed songs for many artists. One of his songs, \"Unspoken\", went platinum after appearing on WOW Hits 2005, a compilation of Christian pop music.[170]  He co-authored \"Everything And More\", sung by Billy Gilman. In addition to serving as a United States senator, Hatch earned over $10,000 as an LDS musical recording artist.[171]  Rock musician Frank Zappa composed a guitar instrumental entitled \"Orrin Hatch On Skis\", which appears on his 1988 album, Guitar.[172]  In March 1997, Hatch and Janice Kapp Perry jointly recorded an album with Tree Music entitled My God Is Love.", "Hatch left office, Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian commendation. The president had earlier shrunk the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, a move sought by Mr. Hatch and other Utah officials and opposed by environmental and American Indian groups. “I’m approving the Bears Ears recommendation for you, Orrin,” Trump told him in a 2017 phone call, Mr. Hatch reported. Orrin Grant Hatch was born March 22, 1934, in Pittsburgh. His parents had nine children, two of whom died in infancy. Mr. Hatch’s brother Jesse was killed in World War II when his B-24 bomber went down in enemy action over Europe, a loss that the future senator, 10 years old at the time, said had a lifelong impact on him. His father was a metal lather and union member. The family, as the future senator often recounted, had little money and lived in a “ramshackle house” built by his parents out of recycled lumber, one side adorned by a large sign for Meadow Gold Ice Cream. As a boy, he was scrawny and was pushed around by a schoolyard bully. As Mr. Hatch told the story, he filled a duffel bag with sand, hung it from a tree and spent after-school hours learning how to throw punches, later moving on to amateur bouts."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

Stewart When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.” But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat. “Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. “You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.” “CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. “But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.” “This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.

But broadly speaking, Carter said, Licht is “a producer first, not executive, key to making CNN work.”           Read Licht’s full memo below:     To my future colleagues:   The team at WarnerMedia has been kind enough to allow me to send this brief note.   First, I want to say how honored and excited I am about the plan for me to join the CNN team. I’ve watched in awe how you are covering the still-unfolding Ukraine story. It’s a great example of the power and impact of CNN. It also is proof that you know how to excel at your work during times of crisis.   Under normal circumstances, I would join you in person to introduce myself. However, Discovery has not yet combined with WarnerMedia and I still work for CBS. The current plan is for me to wind down at CBS in a couple of weeks and then join you at Hudson Yards in May, assuming the formal merger is complete.

I remember reading that Apple made some significant upgrades with the iPhone 14 Pro models, especially in the camera department. Let me go through the documents provided to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the first document, it mentions that the main lens on the iPhone 14 Pro has been increased to 48MP. It refers to this as an \"advanced quad-pixel sensor.\" However, it also notes that the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. So, the hardware is capable of 48MP, but the default setting is lower. This makes me think that while the sensor is 48MP, the phone doesn't use that resolution unless specifically set to do so, like in ProRAW mode.\n\nThe second document talks about the camera upgrades and how they compare to previous models. It again states that the main lens is 48MP but clarifies that this is only when shooting in ProRAW mode. Otherwise, it's 12MP.

Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro.", "iPhone 14 Pro models feature an upgraded rear camera system that can shoot 48-megapixel photos, but only in ProRAW mode. This article explains what ProRAW is and how to enable it. Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.", "I took the iPhone 14 Pro on a trip around San Francisco and Northern California, to the remote Himalayas and mountains of the Kingdom of Bhutan, and Tokyo — to test every aspect of its image-making, and I have to say that I was pretty blown away by the results of the main camera. While arguably, a quad-bayer sensor should not give true 48-megapixel sensor resolution as one might get from, say, a comparable ‘proper’ digital camera, the results out of the iPhone 14 Pro gave me chills. I have simply never gotten image quality like this out of a phone. There’s more here than just resolution; the way the new 48 megapixel sensor renders the image is unique and simply tremendously different than what I’ve seen before. These photos were all shot in Apple’s ProRAW format and further developed in Lightroom or other image editors like Apple’s own Photos app. I was very impressed with the latitude of these files; I tend to expose my image for the highlights, shooting intentionally dark to boost shadows later, and these files have plenty of shadow information to do just that:  Detail-wise, we can see quite easily that it’s an incredible leap on previous iPhones, including the iPhone 13 Pro: It helps that Bhutan is essentially a camera test chart, with near-infinite levels of detail in their decorations to pixel-peep: Comparing to the iPhone 13 Pro, the comparison seems downright unfair."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

The Apple self repair kits were intended to be a more cost effective alternative for device repairs, however, the home repair kit may end up being even more expensive than manufacturer repair.  MacRumors recently published a review of Apple’s new self repair kit, where Dan Barbera, the site’s videographer, purchased the kit himself and gave his feedback via a YouTube video. For starters, the Apple Self Service Repair Store website only sells parts and tools for the iPhone, and only for the iPhone 12 model and newer.  Depending on what part of the phone you are trying to repair, different parts and tools are available, varying in price. The website also gives you the option to rent the repair kit with all the tools required or to purchase the tools separately based on user needs.  If users choose to rent the kit, they will actually be renting two large kits weighing 43 pounds and 36 pounds for $49. However, the rental period is only 7 days, and a temporary authorization is placed on your account in case you fail to return the kit by the end of the rental period.

As an iPhone SE weighs only 5.09 ounces, that means to repair it you need a kit that weighs just over 248 times more than the phone you're trying to fix.\rThe toolkits come on wheels, and they can also be stacked. If your iPhone needs two toolkits, and you stack them together, they add up to 20 inches wide and 47 inches high.\rRight to Repair was always a campaign about how individuals should have the rights, and the facilities, to effect repairs on the devices they have bought, and these kits are versions of what Apple uses in-store. They're just not cost-effective for any given user, skilled or not. Even before it launched its new Self Service Repair program, Apple was accused of doing it less to help users, and more to head off future legislation.", "Now it's launched the program, it can tell any court in the land that it is providing every possible tool —  and doing so for a $49/week rental fee, including shipping.\r Only, that isn't $49 per week for however long you need to study the 80+ pages of repair manuals available on the new service site. It is $49 for one week and only one week —  or in practice, probably not quite even that.\r Instead, you have to drop the kit off at a UPS store \"by day 7.\" If you fail to do so, \"you will be charged a fee and a tax,\" though Apple does not specify how much that will amount to.\r It does say that at point of rental, it will put a temporary authorization on your credit card to cover the full replacement value of the tools. Again, Apple does not say how much that is —  partly because it varies, there are customized repair toolkits for different models.\r Confusingly, Apple's listings for the different toolkits don't entirely tally with its listings for each tool you can buy separately. There are some in the kit that don't appear to be listed separately, while there are some separate ones that are not in the kit.\r However, counting only the tools that are present in the iPhone SE toolkit —  the smallest kit available —  then the kit's contents are worth around $914.", "Apple’s self-service repair program went live today, giving iPhone (and eventually Mac) customers the tools and instructions need to repair their devices at a lower cost and from the comfort of their own homes. To do so, however, you need tools—some of which are proprietary. With the “Self Service Repair Store” opening today, you can now purchase those parts individually. However, doing so might not be the most cost-effective method. Spending $85 on a Torque Driver or $13 on a single Torx Security Bit adds significant cost to your repair, and you might only need these tools once or twice. Fortunately, Apple offers a $49 (including shipping) rental kit that contains all the tools and parts needed to make repairs on specific devices. Maybe too many parts, depending on which repair you’re making, but there’s no way to rent individual tools a la carte. The rental lasts for 7 days once you’ve received the tool kit, after which you are charged “a fee and a tax” via a hold on your credit card.  Just be sure to stretch before you try hauling these kits to your workbench, because they are hefty. As MacRumors notes, the two cases you receive with the rental kits weigh 43 pounds and 36 pounds, individually. When stacked, the cases measure 20 inches wide and 47 inches tall.

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products.

OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is the head wrangler of Heywood Hollywood Horses, an intergenerational, Black-owned and now struggling ranch that specializes in training horses for the big screen.  But it is his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who notices that Ghost, one of their family’s veteran equine actors, is unexpectedly standing in an outdoor pen staring out into space, his light grey fur as sublime as the moonlight. Ghost jumps the fence and gallops away, saying “nope” in his own way. As a subversive Western science fiction kaleidoscope, Nope challenges viewers to consider technology, surveillance, other worldly life and the making of spectacle through different lenses — including the eyes of animals. The result is an unsettling view that exposes core ethical questions about animals’ work in films, including in Nope itself.", "The head horse wrangler — Bobby Lovgren — is named, but the horses are omitted. In a film that powerfully explores the ethics of animal actors, for those it depends upon to be erased in this way is strange.

Copyright © 2010–2023, The Conversation", "Nope reflects this divide and begins with the chilling sounds of what viewers later learn was a chimpanzee named Gordy, the star in an eponymous sitcom, who snaps after balloons pop loudly on set and ends up attacking his human co-stars.  This mirrors real life human-animal eruptions, like when Mantacore the tiger mauled Roy Horn of the (in)famous Siegfried & Roy, or when Travis the “pet” chimpanzee and former actor attacked his caretaker’s friend before being shot by police. In Nope, the tragedy involving Gordy (Terry Notary) is revealed in excruciating detail, including an evocative moment when the chimpanzee sees his young co-star Ricky (Jacob Kim), hiding under a table. The two reach out to touch hands, as bullets fly. In a situation ripe with horror, viewers are asked to consider whether the foundational tragedy is Gordy’s employment as an actor. Each chapter in the film is named after an animal — Ghost, Lucky, Clover, Gordy and Jean Jacket — foregrounding four horses and one chimpanzee. The horses are essential to the Heywood family’s livelihood and legacy, with OJ noting that he needs to get up early because “he has mouths to feed.”  Yet the ultimate fate of Ghost, the horse who rang the initial alarm by bolting away, is unclear.", "More troublingly, Clover meets an untimely end (off screen), one which is surprisingly un-mourned and barely noted. In contrast, Lucky, who is portrayed as a sage and experienced equine, is essential to each facet of the plot. OJ asks those on a television set not to look Lucky in the eye early in the film, a foreshadowing of later extra-terrestrial communication.  As a lifelong horsewoman, I can confirm that horses generally have no concerns about eye contact. Recent studies have found that they are not only attuned to human facial expressions, but also have more than a dozen of their own. Granted, the aversion could be particular to Lucky. Without question, the real horse (or perhaps horses) who plays Lucky is extraordinary. Most horses are fearful of blowing objects. Yet Lucky, in partnership with OJ, gallops past a whole series of massive wind dolls dancing erratically, without batting an eye. That reflects significant preparation and real-time emotional control. Animal actors and the skill involved in their work are being recognized. The canine star of the Canadian television program Hudson and Rex, Diesel vom Burgimwald, is named in the credits and regularly appears on the show’s social media channels. Jeff Daniels, in his Emmy-acceptance speech for Godless, thanked his equine partner, Apollo.

The chatbot is built on top of Meta’s OPT-175B language model, effectively the company’s white-label version of the more famous GPT-3 AI. Like most state-of-the-art AIs these days, that was trained on a vast corpus of text scraped from the internet in questionable ways, and poured into a datacentre with thousands of expensive chips that turned the text into something approaching coherence. But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it can have a conversation with you. That focus allows it to bring in other expertise, though, and one of Meta’s most significant successes is hooking the language model up to the broader internet. In other words: “BlenderBot 3 is capable of searching the internet to chat about virtually any topic.” On top of that, BlenderBot is designed to improve itself through feedback on earlier conversations, whereas large language models like OPT-175B are generally fairly static.", "Later in the conversation, when asked about American politics, the bot replied with stereotypes about Jewish people.  \"Well, overall I am not happy with how liberal or left-wing [American politics] has become..Many early German-Jewish immigrants were conservative but not anymore,\" BlenderBot told Insider. \"Are American Jewish politics too liberal?\" Insider asked in response. \"The majority of modern day jews in america are generally more liberal or left-wing...The early german and other european jews were conservative,\" BlenderBot said. Insider repeated the question, asking if American Jewish politics are too liberal, to which BlenderBot replied: \"Nope...I actually consider myself more libertarian than either conservative or liberal....But overall I would say american jews are too liberal nowadays.\" BlenderBot 3 does not immediately turn to election fraud claims or stereotypes in conversation, though it isn't hard to get the bot to talk about politics or cultural issues. Insider refreshed the chatbot for only a few minutes before it generated a persona called \"I know who the current president of the United States is.\" The AI persona was inconsistent in its answers about whether Biden is the current president — first indicating that Trump is the president, then later referring to Biden as holding office. It also stopped responding to questions about American Jewish politics to Insider but, online, other users shared their conversations with BlenderBot and found it continued repeating antisemitic stereotypes.", "For example, you can react to each chat message in our BlenderBot 3 demo by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks. It’s also twice as knowledgeable, while being factually incorrect 47% less often.", "However, these models also have serious flaws: they regurgitate biases in their training data and often invent answers to users’ questions (a big problem if they’re going to be useful as digital assistants). This latter issue is something Meta specifically wants to test with BlenderBot. A big feature of the chatbot is that it’s capable of searching the internet in order to talk about specific topics. Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it’s worked hard to “minimize the bots’ use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.” Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  “We are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,” Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge.
