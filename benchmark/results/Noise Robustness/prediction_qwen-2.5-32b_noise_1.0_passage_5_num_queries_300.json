The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie.

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either. This Saturday, when Georgia Tech faces Pittsburgh (8 p.m. ET, Georgia Tech Sports Network from Legends Sports), the coach’s son from Ganado will continue the next chapter in his career, charting a path few in college football have duplicated.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself. He was always a coach, so I got to see first-hand how investing in other people and team dynamics lead to shared joy in life.", "Jason Semore is a former Ganado High School football player who now is a linebackers coach at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta.

Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "The 49ers reportedly requested to wear an all-white third jersey ensemble for Super Bowl LIV, which the San Francisco Chronicle noted they could do with special permission from the league; the league never granted such permission, and the 49ers instead opted for their standard uniform of white jerseys with gold pants.[76]  Fifteen different regions have hosted Super Bowls.

Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]", "At Super Bowl LV, it was Tom Brady stealing the show yet again, but for the first time in his career, not while wearing a New England Patriots jersey.  Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set. Super Bowl LVIII will be hosted by Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, and Super Bowl LVIX will be at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, home of the Saints.", "Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).  Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H.

Describing Truth Social as a \"terrible name\", Musk joked that it should be renamed \"Trumpet\".[125][126]  Following Musk's comments on Twitter, the Truth Social app rose in popularity, returning to the number 1 position for free iOS apps on Apple's App Store on April 30, with the Twitter app at number 2; DWAC shares also rose in value.[127][128]  DWAC's share price fell after Musk's announcement of his intention to buy Twitter.[129] Truth Social CEO Devin Nunes later stated that Musk had been encouraged by Trump to buy Twitter;[130] Musk denied this, saying \"This is false. I've had no communication, directly or indirectly, with Trump, who has publicly stated that he will be exclusively on Truth Social.", "Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to \"fuck\" him. According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.  Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week. According to a press release from Wednesday, the initial web app rollout was scheduled for some time over the next week or two.", "[114] A U.S.-based reporter for the BBC attempted to sign up in early April and was placed on a waitlist with about 1.4 million requests ahead of him.[115]  On April 4, it was reported that Josh Adams and Billy Boozer, the platform's chief of technology and chief of product development respectively, had left the company.[52][17] A report in The Washington Post stated Truth Social was \"falling apart\", with problems mounting on multiple fronts.[116] A Guardian article compared Truth Social with Trump Steaks and Trump Vodka.[17]  As of late April 2022, MarketWatch reported Truth Social had around 513,000 active daily users, compared to Twitter's reported active daily userbase of 217 million.[117]  Usership figures were not available, but Trump was reported on August 19, 2022, to have 3.9 million Truth Social followers. He had had 89 million on Twitter and 34 million on Facebook before being banned from both platforms.[118]  As of early June 2022, SimilarWeb reported Truth Social's iOS app as ranking #49 in the social networking category of apps on the Apple App Store.[119] As of October 2022, the iOS app had sunk to #75 in the social networking category.[120]", "However, the social network delivered early when it comes to the web app at least. No word yet on when Truth Social will submit an Android app so Trump can stop complaining about Google.   More in", "In early March 2022, multiple sources reported that Truth Social usage remained low, with Trump himself not having posted to his account since his first message two weeks earlier and his account having only 140,000 followers—less than 0.2% of the 90 million followers he had on Twitter before his account was banned.[81][108] The Daily Dot reported the Truth Social iOS app had fallen from the number one slot for downloads on the Apple App Store to number 84.[110] The Daily Beast reported Trump was dissatisfied with the social network's progress.[109][68]  At the end of March 2022, TheWrap reported that weekly installations of the Truth Social app had fallen from 872,000 in its launch week to around 60,000 per week, a reduction of over 90%. Visits to truthsocial.com had also fallen, from 6 million per week to 1.9 million. According to Sensor Tower, Truth Social had been downloaded 1.2 million times by late March.[111] In early April 2022, Bloomberg News reported that shares in Truth Social's publicly traded holding company Digital World Acquisition Corp.

This can be a great idea, considering the fact that Google already successfully did it for mobile phones and that in VR we had a company, Valve, which did something similar for PCVR.  The question is if the XR hardware OEMs would like to use this new Google platform, and especially if they really want to leave Google all the revenues from the sales of the applications on the Play Store, which is where the real money is.

Microsoft would thus make a radical U-turn away from Hololens 1 and 2, whose development started almost ten years ago. According to the report, the first AR glasses Microsoft developed under the codename \"Fortaleza\" reportedly had a puck-shaped feed, like Magic Leap's device. That version had been abandoned in favor of an integrated solution. The first Hololens emerged from this project, called \"Baraboo\".

The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report.", "At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.) These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "Meta pulled the plug on a large-scale rollout of the custom chip, which was planned for 2022, and instead placed orders for billions of dollars’ worth of Nvidia GPUs that required major redesigns of several of its data centers. In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel.

The information provided mostly discusses the film \"Avengers: Endgame\" and mentions \"The Boys\" as a TV series, but does not provide concrete details about a TV show called \"The Endgame.\" Therefore, there isn't enough information to determine the genre of a TV show called \"The Endgame.\"", "docs": ["October 30, 2020\t\t • 3  For the last decade, Marvel has led the adaptations of superhero comic books into films. In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).", "Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"Endgame is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[196] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Avengers: Endgame achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[197] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, such as Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com, who stated that Endgame is \"a more patient, focused film [than Infinity War], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[198] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of RogerEbert.com, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with Infinity War, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that Endgame is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film].", "7] The series premiered on February 21, 2022.[2] On May 12, 2022, NBC canceled the series after one season.[3]  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 33% approval rating based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"While Morena Baccarin's vampish performance is commendably campy, The Endgame is too contrived and silly to justify its labyrinthine structure.\"[19] On Metacritic, the series has a score of 44 out of 100, based on 7 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[20]", "Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War.  The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters.

This was followed by the outbreak of the war in Donbas, which began in April 2014 when armed Russia-backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings, proclaiming the independent Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.[31][32] Russian troops were involved in the conflict.[33][34][35] The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.[36] A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.[37][38] In 2021, Putin refused offers from Zelenskyy to hold high-level talks, and the Russian government endorsed an article by former president Dmitry Medvedev arguing that it was pointless to deal with Ukraine while it remained a \"vassal\" of the United States.[39]  The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land to create Novorossiya (New Russia).[40] Analyst Vladimir Socor argued that Putin's 2014 speech after the annexation was a \"manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism\".", "346] This came as the culmination of prolonged infighting and power struggles between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defense.[347] After around 24 hours, the Wagner Group backed down and agreed to a peace deal in which Wagner's leader Yevgeny Prigozhin would go into exile in Belarus, and his forces would be free of prosecution.[346] On 27 June, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported that Ukraine were \"highly likely\" to have reclaimed territory in the eastern Donbas region occupied by Russia since 2014 among its advances. Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.[348]  Aerial warfare began on the first day of the invasion. By September, the Ukrainian air force was still at 80% of its prewar strength and had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.[349][350] By late December, 173 Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs were confirmed to have been shot down, whereas Russia had lost 171 aircraft. With the beginning of the invasion, dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.[80][81] Dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine also reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] Starting in mid-October, Russian forces launched massive missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, intending to knock out energy facilities throughout the country.", "[41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]", "Jan 29, 2022 ...

In response, the Russians attacked Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving many without power and water. The Associated Press Putin delivered a speech outlining his plan to mobilize an additional 300,000 troops in an effort to reclaim lost territory. The decision was highly controversial, with reports of men who were past the age of conscription being told to turn up for conscription. In response, by some estimates thousands of young Russian men fled the country, many with no plan to return. The Associated Press Putin signed final papers to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – following Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the West dismissed as shams. In response, the U.S. and its allies slapped sanctions on more than 1,000 Russian people and companies, building on significant financial penalties already imposed on the nation since the invasion.

Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments.

The altercation began when Chris Rock made a joke about Will Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, referring to her shaved head, a condition she has due to lupus. Will Smith, visibly upset by the joke, walked onto the stage and slapped Chris Rock. Following the incident, Smith briefly addressed the audience, though the specifics of his statement vary in the sources—some reports suggest Smith made a brief comment about respecting his wife, while others mention him apologizing to the Academy and his fellow nominees. The ceremony continued with other segments, including Smith's acceptance of the Best Actor award for his role in \"King Richard,\" though the atmosphere was markedly affected by the incident.\n\nThe aftermath of the incident included a variety of reactions, with many criticizing Smith's use of violence, while some defended him as standing up for his wife. Smith later issued a public apology to Rock, and the Academy addressed the inadequacy of their response to the incident, promising to handle such issues more effectively in the future. The event garnered significant media attention and was the subject of widespread discussion about respect, violence, and the appropriate boundaries of humor and behavior in public and professional settings.", "docs": ["Musician Questlove and film producers David Dinerstein, Robert Fyvolent, and Joseph Patel were on stage immediately after the incident to accept the Best Documentary Feature award for Summer of Soul, and some commenters opined that this award had been overshadowed by the incident.[77][78][79] The distracted audience searched Twitter for information on Rock and Smith.[14] Gabrielle Ulubay of Marie Claire wrote that Summer of Soul \"deserved to have its moment, and Questlove's touching speech and tribute to his parents deserved to have our full attention—but instead, the world kept its mind on Will Smith and Chris Rock and its eyes on Twitter\".[80]  Questlove was asked about the incident by a reporter in a backstage press conference immediately after leaving the stage, and declined: \"I'm not talking about that tonight, this is about the Harlem Cultural Festival.\"[81] In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next night, Questlove said he did not notice the slap in the moment because he was using Transcendental Meditation to curb his anxiety before the winner was called, and did not realize what had happened until \"maybe three seconds before I spoke words\".[82][83]  Reactions from celebrity attendees at the Academy Awards varied. In general, there was strong condemnation of Smith's violence and support for Rock, though some defended Smith's actions or refused to side solely with either man.", "Noah then pointed out how in Smith’s memoir, the actor shared that he grew up being afraid of conflict.  \t“It was a lot of things,” Smith said in response. “It was the little boy that watched his father beat up his mother, you know. All of that just bubbled up in that moment. That’s not who I want to be.”  \tWatch the interview here.  \tAcademy President Janet Yang reiterated during the 2023 Oscars Nominees Luncheon that the organization’s response to the 2022 ceremony was “inadequate” and that “we must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively” on similar issues in the future.  \t“As I’m sure you all remember we experienced an unprecedented event at the Oscars,” Yang said. “What happened on stage was wholly unacceptable and the response from the organization was inadequate. We learned from this that the Academy must be fully transparent and accountable in our actions and particularly in times of crisis.”  \t“We must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively for ourselves and for our industry. You should and can expect no less from us going forward,” she added. “We are committed to maintaining the highest of standards while creating the changes we wish to see in our industry.”  \tDuring Netflix’s first live special Chris Rock: Selective Outrage!", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally.

This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

I'm fully embracing the challenge of bringing an ode to one of the most iconic mediums in the world to life. What an honor.\"[25] Four months later, actresses and comedians Regina Hall, Amy Schumer, and Wanda Sykes were announced as hosts of the gala during an interview with Packer on Good Morning America.[5] This marked the first time that three people had shared hosting duties for the Oscars since Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn, and Paul Hogan presided over the 59th ceremony held in 1987.[26]  This year, the show was centered around the theme \"Movie Lovers Unite\".", "Due to continued concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Academy decided once again to allow films that were released via video on demand or streaming to be eligible for the awards on the condition that said films were originally scheduled to have a theatrical release prior to the start of the pandemic.

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film The Fabulous Baron Munchausen combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac.[citation needed]", "—Jia Tolentino, New York Times bestselling author of Trick MirrorThe gripping story of one scientist in outer space, another who watches over him, the family left behind, and the lengths people will go to protect the people and planet they loveFor twenty years, Alex has believed that his gene-edited super-algae will slow and even reverse the effects of climate change. His obsession with his research has jeopardized his marriage, his relationships with his kids, and his own professional future. When the Son sisters, founders of the colossal tech company Sensus, offer him a chance to complete his research, he seizes the opportunity. The catch? His lab will be in outer space on Parallaxis, the first-ever luxury residential space station built for billionaires. Alex and six other scientists leave Earth and their loved ones to become Pioneers, the beta tenants of Parallaxis. But Parallaxis is not the space palace they were sold. Day and night, the embittered crew builds the facility under pressure from Sensus, motivated by the promise that their families will join them. At home on Earth, much of the country is ablaze in wildfires and battered by storms. In Michigan, Alex’s teenage daughter, Mary Agnes, struggles through high school with the help of the ubiquitous Sensus phones implanted in everyone’s ears, archiving each humiliation, and wishing she could go to Parallaxis with her father—but her mother will never allow it.", "She has ditched academia for a gig at Sensus, where she heads a project known as Views. Unbeknownst to the Pioneers, Tess is watching their every move, studying them as part of Sensus’ efforts to predict human behavior. In addition to surveilling the Pioneers, Sensus founder Katherine Son employs Tess to spy on her sister and cofounder. Charismatic younger sister Rachel Son is the public face of the company, but it’s the shadowy eldest, Katherine, who pulls all the strings. As the climate crisis on Earth accelerates and billionaires clamber for Parallaxis I to open, Katherine sends Rachel to the space station with one goal—get it ready, or else. Name a hot-button social issue and it’s likely Rebecca Scherm’s A House Between Earth and the Moon touches on it. This is a Big Ideas book. In addition to climate change, space tourism, and Big Tech, plot points also hinge on deepfakes, cyberbullying, screen addiction, abortion rights, and surveillance. Toggling the perspective between Alex, Tess, Mary Agnes, and Rachel, and from Earth into space, a less-nimble author might’ve wound up with a story spread too thin, told too shallowly. But each character is fully realized, as is the expansive world in which they struggle to live.", "© 2023 Goodreads, Inc.", ") Mary Agnes worries that her schlubby dad will be changed by the posh Parallaxis I she sees in promotional videos, but her fear is misplaced. Parallaxis I is portrayed as pristine in advertisements but barely functions in reality. The Pioneers must double as amateur space-station builders as they scramble to get the place up and running. Alex thinks of it as a “freezing, comfortless warehouse.” It’s like a zero-gravity version of “luxury” skyscrapers riddled with issues like 432 Park, its exclusivity and high price tag obscuring how janky it is.

Despite its glaring issues, some of Alex’s teammates are planning to bring their families up, like Lenore, the team’s 3D fabricator, who plans to have her grandparents come. She frames it like they’re simply space enthusiasts, but there’s a financial angle. On Earth, they’re broke. In fact, several of the Pioneers are motivated by precarity. Meanwhile, even as Sensus’ guinea pigs sleep in makeshift dorms as they try to make the space station functional, the Sons are peddling Parallaxis I to investors as the one place privacy can truly be guaranteed.

The New Era Pinstripe Bowl appearance, though a grace of some measure was probably more of a curse since it might have been better just walking away from the entire mess of the last three seasons and spending some serious “reflection time” sorting it out. The team that took the field in Yankee Stadium was stripped of major players either by choice or circumstance.  Connor Blumrick was brave and had a winning attitude to finish out the season with largely nothing more than three Read-Option running plays and a couple of pass plays that he’d managed to practice enough to not just look like another running back behind the center. The loss to Maryland in that bowl had to have been one of the lowest points in the locker room since the massive loss to Duke, at home a couple of years earlier. It was for entirely different reasons, but this one was the reality that the team had no offense, and no head coach.  The irony is that the new Offensive Coordinator picked by the new Head Coach got his coaching start at Maryland. It’s only been 12 years since Tyler Bowen - Football Coach - Virginia Tech Athletics (hokiesports.com) was a graduate assistant there. About a third of that time was at the FCS level.", "To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.", "The problem has always been that Virginia Tech’s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let’s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed.", "The 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente’s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.", "“I’ve always heard good things about Brent. … Good energy. Cares about the players. And obviously a good track record at Penn State. So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players.

People no longer focus on their occupation, religion or nationality. Crypto is filling this interesting role, bringing together people through memes, capitalism and community values,” she explained. As such, Demirors noted that she believes “crypto cults” are attracting many people because it provides a sense of purpose, along with capital. “There is an interesting convergence happening,” she said. While the crypto space continues to attract more participants, Staci Warden, CEO of the Algorand Foundation, told Cointelegraph that Alogrand views this crypto winter as an opportunity for building. “We think that there will be some shakeout in the industry and we are ready to innovate,” she remarked.  Specifically, Warden explained that one area the Algorand community is focused on is what Web3 means for financial inclusion.", "© 2023 | Terms & Conditions | Privacy & Cookies Policy", "Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told Cointelegraph that he thinks the bipartisan bill is “terrific,” further noting that the bill contains modest differences in how stablecoins are treated compared with his stablecoin approach, which was drafted in April this year. Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction.

Though it will be difficult for them to overtake Tesla sales any time soon, Tesla will witness a reduction in its share across major markets. The reason behind this is the price band in which Tesla operates. It mostly operates in the high-to-premium price band, whereas the traditional OEMs are planning to launch vehicles in the budget segment.

Under normal circumstances, I would join you in person to introduce myself. However, Discovery has not yet combined with WarnerMedia and I still work for CBS. The current plan is for me to wind down at CBS in a couple of weeks and then join you at Hudson Yards in May, assuming the formal merger is complete.   In the meantime, I plan to do a lot of listening. I am familiar with CNN as a viewer, a journalist, a competitor and the husband of a former CNN staffer.", "The tenor of our voice holistically has to reflect that.”   Just this week, Licht announced the departure of Michael Bass, a top programming executive at the network for years.  Licht has said there are lessons for CNN and other leading news organizations to learn about how to cover Trump, who is running for president in 2024, at a time of increased partisanship in media and sluggish ratings across the cable news business, but particularly for CNN.  “I don’t, do not, want someone who’s producing an hour of television on CNN saying, ‘You know what? I could lead with this or I could lead with that. I’m going to lead with that because it’ll get a better number.’ I want people leading and stacking their shows in a way based on journalism and what’s important,” Licht said during a separate interview with the journalist Kara Swisher last week. “Let me worry about the ratings.

While not explicitly stated in the provided text, the document suggests that the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, faced Marine Le Pen in the second round. It mentions that the election was closer than the 2017 race but still resulted in a victory for Macron. Also, specific references to Le Pen's acknowledgment of defeat and her statement about the upcoming legislative elections imply that Macron was the winner of the presidential election.", "docs": ["8] On 13 July 2021, Government Spokesman Gabriel Attal announced the dates for the election, respectively 10 April 2022 for the first round and 24 April 2022 for the eventual second round.[9]  To be listed on the first-round ballot, candidates needed to secure 500 signatures (often referred to as parrainages in French) from national or local elected officials from at least 30 different departments or overseas collectivities, with no more than a tenth of these signatories from any single department.  The signatures were submitted to the Constitutional Council, which is the sole authority to designate participants.[10]  Following the 2017 presidential election, The Republicans (LR) sent its members a questionnaire on the topic of the \"re-foundation\" of the party; of the 40,000 respondents, 70% voted against an open primary like that which was held in 2016 to determine the party nominee.[11] In a document dated 17 October 2017, the Socialist Party (PS) wrote that the financing of the 2022 presidential campaign was not assured despite \"economic restructuring\" but still planned to spend €12,000,000, the maximum legally permitted before the first round. According to the report, the party's leadership had seriously considered the possibility of not presenting a PS candidate in 2022.[12]", "79][80][81] The projections, based on actual ballot papers, also showed that 28% of registered voters did not show up to the second round,[82] making it the lowest turnout since 1969.[83] Official results showed that the turnout was 71.99%, with over 13 million abstentions in the second round, in addition to over 8.6% of ballots cast being blank or invalid (a marked increase over the first round).[77]  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's first round map  Map of which candidate placed second in every department during the first round  2022 French presidential election's first round in Petite Couronne by commune  Results of the first round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the first round by municipality  First-place candidate by country (Overseas French) during the first round  Simplified 2022 French presidential election's second round map  Results of the second round by parliamentary constituency  Results of the second round by municipality  The New York Times commented that the race was much closer than in 2017, when Macron won 66.1% of the vote to Le Pen's 33.9%, but that Macron's margin was wider than expected prior to the election.[85] Le Pen conceded defeat minutes after the estimated results were released,[83] but still called the outcome a victory for her political movement and for the upcoming parliamentary elections.", "“This will be my responsibility.” At Le Pen’s election night event, at a Parisian park pavilion, the release of projected results provoked a mix of boos and solemn silence. But the far-right leader remained defiant. She denounced “two weeks of unfair, brutal and violent methods” to prevent her win, and she said that “tonight’s result represents in itself a resounding victory.” Macron vs. Le Pen 2022: What to know about France’s presidential election runoff Sunday’s result marked the far right’s best finish in a French presidential election. It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.", "Le Pen called her result “a shining victory,” saying that “in this defeat, I can’t help but feel a form of hope.”  Breaking through the threshold of 40% of the vote is unprecedented for the French far-right. Le Pen was beaten 66% to 34% by Macron in 2017 and her father got less than 20% against Chirac. She and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round on April 10, both quickly pitched forward Sunday night to France’s legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron. Le Pen’s score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers.  Le Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize “our daily lives — salaries, taxes, pensions.” The drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor.", "Marine Le Pen, the president of the National Rally (RN), announced on 16 January 2020 that she would be running in the election. She previously ran in the 2012 and 2017 presidential elections as the party's candidate, then called the National Front (FN). She came third in 2012 with 17.9% of the vote in the first round and second in 2017 with 21.3% of the vote in the first round and 33.9% of the vote in the second round. Le Pen was elected to the National Assembly in the 2017 French legislative election.[13]  Jean Lassalle, who ran in the 2017 presidential election under the Résistons! banner, coming in seventh place with 1.2% of the vote, announced that he would run again.[14] In 2020, MP Joachim Son-Forget, a radiologist who was elected to the National Assembly for La République En Marche! (LREM) in 2017, formed a new political party called Valeur Absolue and announced his intention to enter the race for the presidency. He had resigned from the LREM group after posting tweets in 2018 that were deemed sexist; he then joined the UDI and Independents group in 2019 before resigning his membership later that year.[15]"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro.", "When you try to take a photo with the main camera and are standing very close to a subject, the iPhone 14 Pro switches to the ultrawide camera and crops the framing to mimic the main camera. This allows for a closer focus, which is great for close-up shots of small things.  Macro mode lets you get within inches of your subject and keep it in focus, like this Lego car. Last year's 13 Pro had a similar feature, but with the new ultrawide, macro photos have better image quality, especially in medium and low light. Another macro photo from the 14 Pro. The 14 Pro nails the focus on Lego Batman in this macro photo. The telephoto camera is basically identical to the one on last year's 13 Pro, but it gets a lift from the 14 Pro's Photonic Engine. Under good lighting, like in the picture below, the telephoto camera takes good photos. Notice in particular the colors and how the camera handles skin tones. A telephoto shot of folks noshing in a parklet. As with the ultrawide, image quality is a step behind the main camera -- especially in dimmer environments. I took this photo of the Embarcadero's Ferry Building during blue hour, with the 14 Pro's telephoto camera. Below is a Portrait mode picture of Maisie the cat taken indoors with the telephoto camera.", "While the sensor size of the front-facing camera isn’t massive (nor do we believe it has to be), upgrades in its lens and sensor allowed for some significant improvements in dynamic range, sharpness and quality. The actual jump between a previous-generation iPhone’s front camera and this new shooter are significant enough for most people to notice immediately. In our testing, the iPhone 14 Pro achieved far sharper shots with vastly — and we mean vastly — superior dynamic range and detail. The previous cameras were simply not capable of delivering very high-quality images or video in challenging mixed light or backlit subjects. We’re seeing some significant advancements made through better software processing (something Apple calls the Photonic Engine) and hardware.  While the sensor is larger and there is now variable focus (yes, you can use manual focus on the selfie camera with an app like Halide now!) you shouldn’t expect beautiful bokeh; the autofocus simply allows for much greater sharpness across the frame, with a slight background blur when your subject (no doubt a face) is close enough. Most of the time it’s subtle, and very nice.  Notable is that the front facing camera is able to focus quite close — which can result in some pleasing shallow depth of field between your close-up subject and the background: Low light shots are far more usable, with less smudging apparent.", "Impressively, the TrueDepth sensor also retains incredibly precise depth data sensing, despite its much smaller package in the Dynamic Island cutout area.  This is one of the times where Apple glosses over a very significant technological leap that a hugely talented team no doubt worked hard on. The competing Android flagship phones have not followed Apple down the technological path of high-precision, infrared-based Face ID, as it requires large sensors that create screen cutouts.  The ‘notch’ had shrunk in the last generation of iPhones, but this far smaller array retains incredible depth sensing abilities that we haven’t seen another product even approximate. And while shipping a software feat — the dynamic island deserves all the hype it gets — Apple also shipped a significant camera upgrade that every user will notice in day to day usage. Time to break into that large camera bump on the rear of iPhone 14 Pro. The ultra-wide camera, introduced with iPhone 11 in 2019, has long played a background role to the main wide camera due to its smaller sensor and lack of sharpness.  Last year, Apple surprised us by giving the entire ultra-wide package a significant upgrade: a more complex lens design allowed for autofocus and extremely-close focus for macro shots, and a larger sensor collected more light and allowed for far more detailed shots.  We reviewed it as finally growing into its own: a ‘proper’ camera.", "It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up.", "Self Service Repair is intended for individuals with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices.

(You can just buy a battery if you want.) I expected Apple would send me a small box of screwdrivers, spudgers, and pliers; I own a mini iPhone, after all. Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases — 79 pounds of tools — on my front porch. I couldn’t believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple’s paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started.

Analysts estimate that Amazon's revenue growth will continue to slow to a pace of just 5.3% YOY for Q2 FY 2022. This is the smallest quarterly revenue growth the company has experienced in at least four and a half years.

AWS offers developers a range of on-demand technology services, such as compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. These services are primarily used by start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions. The company's AWS business generates much higher margins than its e-commerce business. In FY 2021, Amazon's global retail sales- and subscription-based business segments generated about 87.5% of the company's total revenue while AWS accounted for a mere 12.5%.

Financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud, while affected by foreign exchange. We’re working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.” In the earnings call, Porat said data centers and hardware were driving up the company’s costs of revenues: “The biggest driver of the year-on-year increase in other cost of revenues does continue to be data centers and other operations. The change really here this quarter in Q3, the second largest driver was hardware.” She noted that the company thought businesses and governments are ‘still in the early days of public cloud adoption.' “We continue to invest accordingly,” she added. “We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability.” Google Cloud regions still waiting to go live include Berlin, Dammam, Doha, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, and Turin.

This was down slightly on the previous quarter. Q2 revenues in its Intelligent Cloud division was $20.", "Focus on AMZN Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) reported robust growth in earnings and revenue in many quarters over the last two years as customers took increasing advantage of the company's online offerings during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the company's revenue growth now is decelerating dramatically. The causes include a slowing economy and an overbuilt fulfillment network that's squeezing profits. Also, Amazon is being pressured by high inflation and ongoing legal actions by antitrust regulators.   Investors will be watching to see how these factors have impacted Amazon's performance when the company reports earnings on July 28, 2022 for Q2 FY 2022. Analysts predict a sharp drop in earnings per share (EPS) year-over-year (YOY), coupled with the smallest revenue gains in at least 19 quarters. Note that all EPS data throughout reflects Amazon's 20-for-1 stock split, which took effect in early June.   Investors will also be focusing on revenue generated by Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's high-margin cloud computing business. AWS still comprises a relatively small share of the company's overall revenue, but it generates a substantial portion of Amazon's operating income.

The game had sold 1.86 million copies by March 2023. An expansion taking place before the events of the game, Future Redeemed, was released in April 2023.  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an action role-playing game with a large open world. Unlike previous Xenoblade games, the game allows for up to seven party members to participate in battles at once, including the main party of six and an additional \"Hero\" character. Up to 19 Heroes can be recruited to the party through story events or sidequests, each with different skills and abilities. Party members also have the ability to change their character class, granting them access to different abilities; raising a Hero's affinity with the party will unlock their class for use. Like the previous entries, the game has an open world design, with a day-and-night time cycle that affects in-game events, such as the availability of quests and items. The game takes place in a continuous open world that is the largest map featured in the series to date.[1] It also features a fast travel option for quicker traversal, as well as the option to activate navigation that will mark a line on the ground to follow if players are unsure of how to reach their destination.", "Completing Future Redeemed unlocks an additional challenge battle, through which the player can earn Shulk and Rex as heroes in the main game.[10]  The first ideas for the plot of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came during the development of the second entry of the three games, Xenoblade Chronicles 2. According to Tetsuya Takahashi, creator of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, the Mechonis sword featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles and the Titan of Uraya featured on the cover of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is what sparked the idea of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Bringing the two worlds together, the broken sword of the Mechonis going through the wounded Titan of Uraya is the visual key of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, indicating war between the two worlds, thus the starting idea for this game.[11] In May 2018, Takahashi pitched Xenoblade Chronicles 3 as a new game concept to Nintendo. The first production group of Monolith Soft, known for their work on the Xenoblade Chronicles series, started development on the game in August 2018 after Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country went gold.[12]", "31] Game Informer felt the world didn't have enough to do, and all of the biomes seemed to blend into each other at a certain point, \"Beyond challenging monsters, collecting respawnable drops, and recruiting heroes at Keves or Agnus settlements, there's not much to do or see.\"[28]  PCMag wrote that the Switch seemed unable to keep up with the game's large vistas and combat, \"here are noticeable resolution drops and object pop-in abounds. The frame rate isn't particularly steady, either, and the game can chug at times.\"[41] Eurogamer praised the game for capturing the sense of freedom found in older JRPGs, \"the sensation of running through endless fields of long grass with your companions, facing impossible odds with a spring in your step.\"[30] Polygon liked the new optional content, feeling it was some of the series' best, \"There are well over 100 side quests, and though their objectives could be rote, each told me something about how one lives in this world. It made me care about Aionios as an amalgamation of the land and its peoples.\"[42]  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was the bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 112,728 physical copies being sold."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

(During the intervening years, Muybridge would stand trial for the murder of his wife’s lover and be acquitted on the grounds that it was justifiable homicide — but let’s leave that for a future Peele film.) By Muybridge’s recollection, the series of photographs that became known as “The Horse in Motion” was first published in 1878. The next year, he would begin holding presentations that put his sequential photographs — or, technically, artistic reproductions of them — in motion, using a device he called the zoopraxiscope, a forerunner of the film projector. And as far as “The Horse in Motion” is concerned, some (though not all) of the stills held at the Library of Congress indicate the names of the riders. But those photographs are not the images shown in “Nope.” The Muybridge works in the movie, with the unnamed rider, are from “Plate Number 626,” part of a later series of locomotion studies that Muybridge began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1884 and published in 1887.", "So while the images in “Nope” aren’t, strictly speaking, the horse ride that gave birth to cinema, the pioneering actor, animal wrangler and stunt man shown in them probably is unknown.

But unlike Microsoft, which quickly realised its error and pulled Tay from the net, Meta seems more determined to stick this out. If BlenderBot works as it should, then the combined weight of experience and feedback should filter the outré responses out of its repertoire. If it doesn’t, then the worst that can happen is that Meta must shut down the bot when it stops improving. “As more and more people interact with the demo, we will aim to improve our models using their feedback, and release deployment data and updated model snapshots, for the benefit of the wider AI community,” Meta says. “Together, we can advance responsible conversational AI research in the hope of one day building AI-powered computers that everyone can chat with in genuinely helpful and interesting ways.” Sign up to TechScape Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Tornado warning The US Treasury Department has banned all Americans from using the crypto “mixing service” Tornado Cash.", "“Initial experiments already show that as more people interact with the model, the more it learns from its experiences and the better and safer it becomes over time,” the company says, “though safety remains an open problem.” Let’s pause and take in those last few words before continuing. When Meta announced the project, my eyebrows raised slightly at the sample conversation it had chosen to illustrate the post with – a chat between a user and BlenderBot in which the AI, well, lies. When asked what it’s doing it says “I’ve been working on my new book all night”, and follows up with the claim the book will be its ninth, with previous novels including “a modern retelling of pride and prejudice”. The question of what it means to want an AI to tell the truth is a tricky one. As we saw in June with Google’s LaMDA, the fundamental goal of these models is to provide a user with the appropriate text to finish their prompt: if you ask a machine what it did at the weekend, the machine is probably correct in assuming that you want to engage in light role-play, rather than stick to the facts. Nonetheless, the decision to advertise BlenderBot with a conversation in which it lied to a user is suggestive of the attitude the company is taking with it. The idea is that, by releasing the project as a chatbot on the internet, Meta has more leeway to experiment without risking negative outcomes.", "For example, you can react to each chat message in our BlenderBot 3 demo by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples.

The Wall Street Journal has reported BlenderBot 3 told one of its journalists that Donald Trump was, and will always be, the US president.  A business Insider journalist said the chatbot called Mr Zuckerberg \"creepy\".  Meta has made the BlenderBot 3 public, and risked bad publicity, for a reason. It needs data.  \"Allowing an AI system to interact with people in the real world leads to longer, more diverse conversations, as well as more varied feedback,\" Meta said in a blog post.  Chatbots that learn from interactions with people can learn from their good and bad behaviour. In 2016 Microsoft apologised after Twitter users taught its chatbot to be racist. Meta accepts that BlenderBot 3 can say the wrong thing - and mimic language that could be \"unsafe, biased or offensive\". The company said it had installed safeguards, however, the chatbot could still be rude.

Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes.

Any violations would be treated as plagiarism by the university unless the student obtains the prior written consent from the course instructor.[170][171]  In a poll conducted in March and April 2023, 38% of American students reported they had used ChatGPT for a school assignment without teacher permission. In total, 58% of the students reported having used ChatGPT.[172][173]  In a blinded test, ChatGPT was judged to have passed graduate-level exams at the University of Minnesota at the level of a C+ student and at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a B to B− grade.[174] The performance of ChatGPT for computer programming of numerical methods was assessed by a Stanford University student and faculty in March 2023 through a variety of computational mathematics examples.[175] Assessment psychologist Eka Roivainen administered a partial IQ test to ChatGPT and estimated its Verbal IQ to be 155, which would put it in the top 0.1% of test-takers.[176]", "The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI’s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input. Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users’ devices. “In one case, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,” said Meta security engineers Duc H.

The foundation of ChatGPT is an improved version of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model known as “GPT-3.5.” This fine-tuned language model allows ChatGPT to generate text based on user prompts with impressive accuracy and coherence. When a user interacts with ChatGPT, the chatbot generates text based on the user’s prompt or input. It employs the language model architecture created by OpenAI called the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). The specific GPT used by ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series. However, users who subscribe to ChatGPT Plus have the added advantage of accessing ChatGPT with GPT-4, which is OpenAI’s most advanced model at the time of writing. ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot that leverages a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques to continually improve its responses over time. It is trained to comprehend user instructions in prompts and provide detailed and contextually relevant answers. See More: Can You Buy ChatGPT Stock?

According to OpenAI, GPT-4 \"passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%.\" On Twitter, I've seen many developers testing out GPT-4 with requests for it to code old-school arcade games. While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions. For example, users can input a handmade sketch into the AI chatbot, and it will transform the sketch into a functional web page.", "6] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[7] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[8] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[9] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.  Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[10]  OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[11] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[12] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[13] in downstream scaling laws.", "Sam Altman was interviewed recently for the StrictlyVC program, where he confirms that OpenAI is working on a video model, which sounds incredible but could also lead to serious negative outcomes. While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it much  longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it’s frustrating and I totally get that.” Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters).", "That rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn’t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: “I saw that on Twitter.  It’s complete b——t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. …People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. …We don’t have an actual AGI and I think that’s sort of what’s expected of us and you know, yeah… we’re going to disappoint those people. “ The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won’t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of. But a tweet by technology writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming that will completely change the game. GPT-4 is next level, I hear, for instance.  There is a revolution in AI coming. — Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 8, 2022 Disruption is coming.  GPT-4 is better than anyone expects.", "OpenAI does note, though, that it made improvements in particular areas; GPT-4 is less likely to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals, for one. The company says that GPT-4 is 82% less likely overall to respond to requests for “disallowed” content compared to GPT-3.5 and responds to sensitive requests — e.g. medical advice and anything pertaining to self-harm — in accordance with OpenAI’s policies 29% more often. Image Credits: OpenAI Image Credits: OpenAI There’s clearly a lot to unpack with GPT-4. But OpenAI, for its part, is forging full steam ahead — evidently confident in the enhancements it’s made. “We look forward to GPT-4 becoming a valuable tool in improving people’s lives by powering many applications,” OpenAI wrote. “There’s still a lot of work to do, and we look forward to improving this model through the collective efforts of the community building on top of, exploring, and contributing to the model."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

It said it expects to recognize nearly $1 billion of deferred revenue that remains over time as software updates are delivered. Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla. Last May, in an interview with members of a Tesla owners club, Musk called full self driving \"essential\" for the company. \"It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\" NHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles.

Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the “full self-driving” beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             “He promised your car can be a taxi.

Other elements are new, such as a lens adjustment dial to match the lens distance between the player’s eyes. The new headset is both slimmer and lighter than the first generation. One of the other big changes for comfort is a new vent along the front of the scope, which should help you keep cool (and reduce sweat) during longer gameplay sessions.

Lawrence) is involved with the project. Given the context, if a question asks for the director of the BioShock movie, based on the document, Lawrence is the closest answer provided. However, the document does not definitively state that Lawrence is the director; it only speaks of his involvement and his discussions about the project. Thus, a precise answer based solely on the information provided would require more specific details about Lawrence's role. \n\nGiven the limitations of the document, the most appropriate response based on the provided information is:\nI can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.", "docs": ["Working with Netflix has also given Lawrence a sense of freedom that he believes will help him create a faithful BioShock film without studio interference. He continued on, talking about his discussions with Take-Two Interactive and Ken Levine, the man largely responsible for developing the concept for BioShock: There's always discussions about rating and tone. I don't want to get into it too much now because it's pretty early on in the process, but I certainly have not felt stifled in any way, or sent in any directions with Netflix. I mean, basically me and Cameron [MacConomy] who works with me, and Michael are getting to do what we want to do, which is great. A lot of it is staying really true to the game itself, and we're talking to Take-Two [Interactive] and Ken Levine. Despite the confidence, Lawrence is fully aware of how video game movies have failed in the past. Still, he's convinced that BioShock offers something meatier to the table that can survive the jump to the big screen. When asked if he knew about the disconnect in adaptations, he added: No, I do know what you mean. When I think about that, I go back to what we talked about earlier, which is I think that there's some great video games out there, but they don't always have the weight of actual ideas underneath them.", "Sometimes they have a great aesthetic or something like that, but I feel like often they end up feeling empty because they're not built from real ideas. The thing is, BioShock really is. The whole mythology of that world and the ideas behind it all, there's just so much there. We'll have more here at Collider as the BioShock film gets underway. Keep an eye out for our full interview with Lawrence and check out the trailer for BioShock: The Collection below for a look at everything the series has to offer. Ryan O'Rourke is a senior news writer for Collider and lifelong gamer. A diehard Cubs fan, he contributes to a FanSided blog on the side and can be found glued to a baseball game or his Switch during his spare time.", "When asked what it was about BioShock that made him believe it would be a great movie, he cited the thoughtful nature of the games as well as the gravitas in its premise and its weave of different ideas as reasons the film could hit home with a new audience. He added: First of all, I think it's one of the best games ever created. It's also, I think, one of the most visually unique games ever created. The other thing, and one of the things that always appeals to me, is it is very thematic. There's real ideas and philosophies underneath the game property, and it's really, really, really thought out. A lot of games may have a great world of some kind, or they may have a great lead character, or they may tee you up for great set-pieces, but they don't really have the ideas, they don't have the kind of weight and the gravitas that Bioshock does. The sort of combo of real ideas and philosophies mixed with the unbelievable aesthetic of it. Plus, one of the other things that I love, love, love is that sort of strange mashup of genre, the idea that you have what feels like a period piece, mixed with body horror, mixed with sci-fi. It's one of those great mashups, and I think it can be really unique and really beautiful and really entertaining.", "Lawrence is an in-demand director who is also lined up to direct the Hunger Games prequel movie, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, as well as Constantine 2, so it'll surely be some time before the BioShock movie begins production.

Born and raised in Memphis, Henry  is no stranger to the ever-changing weather of the Mid-South having experienced everything from Ice Storm 94 to the Super Tuesday tornado outbreak in February 2008. Believe it or not, Henry was terrified of thunderstorms until he was seven years old.  That's when his cousin took him outside during a storm (highly advise against that now) and explained to him what was causing all of the scary noise.  It was from that point that his fear became a fascination and now a career! While a junior in high school in Memphis, Henry began shadowing the weather team at CBS affiliate WREG-TV.  He mainly spent his time shadowing Todd Demers on the morning newscast.  He arrived at the station at 4:30 a.m. when his school schedule would allow and spent as much time at WREG as time allowed.  Henry credits this experience with jump starting his career. Henry attended the University of Missouri where he was a member of the Mizzou Storm Chase Team, chasing storms all across the plain states.  Henry's desire to chase storms when most are trying to avoid them is fueled by his passion for weather, and desire to keep people safe in dangerous weather.", "Then • In 1976, I became the first certified meteorologist on nightly local newscasts in St. Louis on KSDK-TV at age 22.

On the air, I integrated moving, color radar graphics with scientific explanations in forecasts. I hold the record for severe weather, live continuous coverage — staying on-air for more than 8 hours in April 2011. By the time I was 29, I became chief meteorologist for ABC’s “Good Morning America” and “World News This Morning” in New York. But I missed severe weather forecasting and returned to KTVI-TV in 1990.

Way to battle, fight and come out on top!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 https://t.co/yGTUmnLuFE Per report, Stollings' complaint said the school and athletic director \"created an environment in which male and heterosexual coaches were treated better than female and gay and lesbian coaches, and men's athletic programs were treated better than female athletic programs.'' Stollings attorney, Peter Ginsberg, told USA Today that she is interested in coaching again, which served as her motivation to settle instead of waiting for the trial.  \"Given the nature of university athletics, most if not all colleges were reticent to engage Marlene while her litigation was continuing against Texas Tech,'' Ginsberg said. \"Now that the litigation is over, the landscape is expected to change significantly.'' However, not everyone is happy with the decision. Some of Stollings' former players told USA Today that they did not wish to see her coach again.", "\"Now that the litigation is over, the landscape is expected to change significantly.’’ “Today, equality wins!’’ Stollings wrote on her Twitter account Wednesday. “Settled! Brought this case to clear my name, set the record straight & contribute to principles of equality & fair treatment. Thrilled! Worth the fight! Grateful to so many including SA's (student athletes), parents & TTU (Texas Tech University) fans. Eager to return to my life’s work!’’ Two former Lady Raiders players under Stollings expressed their concerns about the settlement. “It makes me sick to think there is even a chance she could step back into the basketball world because I would never want anyone to walk through what our team walked through,” one former player, who competed for another Big 12 program after leaving Texas Tech, told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday night. The person spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “The varying degrees and types of abuse have caused lasting damage to my emotional and physical health, most of which I am still working through years later. “Case settled or not, Marlene Stollings should not be given access to any coaching roles. Her actions and words display that she has no regard for her players’ emotional, physical or mental wellbeing."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Finance and Good Morning America.", "Carousel of Time is the ninth studio album from classical crossover singer Jackie Evancho. What’s especially impressive is that Evancho is only twenty-two years old! She first came to national prominence when she was a runner up on America’s Got Talent at ten years of age. Her voice was spectacular, and a big part of the draw was hearing that amazing sound coming from such a young person.  But Jackie Evancho is no longer a child, and in Carousel of Time she turns her fantastic voice to the music of Joni Mitchell. Mitchell, a major force in the counterculture music of the 1960s, had a remarkable knack for writing unique melodies along with thoughtful and insightful lyrics which explored relationships and reflections on life. Even though the melodies were catchy, Mitchell’s tunes always highlighted the lyrics. The popular “Both Sides Now” is a prime example. So, by covering ten of Mitchell’s compositions, Evancho has given herself the opportunity to create an album which sounds like more than just an opportunity to show off her voice. Evancho has had a difficult couple of years, breaking her back in a car accident and recently revealing that she has an eating disorder. The sensitivity with which she delivers these songs suggests that there is something about them that resonates deeply with her. Consequently, in hearing her sing them, they resonate with us as well. (Melody Place)       Robert J.", "Yes, Jackie started to have fame when she wasn’t even a teenager, and now at age 22, has been battling eating disorders for a while now. But Carousel of Time is Jackie’s own glimpse of hope after a dark season, a reminder that songs like Joni’s ‘Both Sides Now’ or ‘River’, could heal someone all the more than they may even realise. Yes, Jackie has a long way to go for complete and full healing from this eating disorder. But she’s nevertheless well on her way. An artist that is well beyond her years, musically and sonically, this is a must-purchase, especially if you’ve been a fan of Jackie’s material in the past and are eager to see what she’s doing now in the meantime, between originally written projects. Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni’s music (and Jackie’s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago. Looking forward to the next original album, whenever that arises. Here’s hoping this album continues to impact and influence, until then.   3 songs to listen to: Circle Game, Both Sides Now, A Case of You Score: 4.", "Going back to the very beginning, Evancho pulls several tracks from Mitchell’s earlier days, opening on “Both Sides, Now,” a song first recorded by Judy Collins in 1968 before Mitchell released it on her second album Clouds a year later—Mitchell herself who re-recorded the song with an orchestral arrangement for her 2000 album Both Sides Now. Carousel of Time also weaves in another one of Evancho’s Clouds covers, “The Gallery.”  When choosing songs from Mitchell’s catalog, Evancho gravitated to songs that immersed her the most. “Picking them was just basically listening to the songs and seeing which ones hit me hard in the chest and gave me chills, and made me feel deeply as I was listening to them,” ” shares Evancho. “I wanted to get across Joni’s beautiful music with a little bit of Jackie in there. I wanted to marry the two.” Slipping into Mitchell’s Blue era, Evancho takes on the title track, along with “River,” and “A Case of You,” off her iconic album, love stories inspired by Mitchell’s relationship with James Taylor. Mitchell’s 1970 album, Ladies of the Canyon, gets attention with Evancho’s tender acoustic wrap on “For Free,” “The Circle Game,” and “Rainy Night House.", "SEE ALSO: JACKIE EVANCHO CONTINUES HER COMEBACK WITH ANOTHER JONI MITCHELL COVER Evancho recently chatted with Talent Recap about the new project, saying that Mitchell is an artist she’s “been very inspired by for a very long time.” She added that something she loves about Mitchell is that she’s “so authentic.” “You know, even for the time period, she did not care what anyone said, as long as she was content with the music,” Evancho shared. “So I think it’s appropriate for the point in my life that I’m going through, and I’m excited to see what everyone thinks of it.” Evancho also shared that she’s “been doing a lot of songwriting,” confirming that fans can expect another album of original songs at some point. As she said, “I will not release until all these originals are done and it is nothing but my work.” The music, the style, the genre, and the essence all fit perfectly with Jackie’s incredible, ethereal voice.  Carousel of Time is now and will be remembered as one of her best gifts to the world. Thank you, Jackie.

Moreover, it added that \"Western criticism\" failed to \"distinguish between truly repugnant regimes and merely flawed ones\", and that many \"indignant pundits\" simply sounded as if they did \"not like Muslims or rich people\".[333] The Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera news organization commented that Qatar's human rights positions had received selected, heightened criticism compared to other countries who had hosted similar events (such as Russia, China, and the United States), deeming the controversy to be hypocritical.[334][335] Incumbent FIFA president Gianni Infantino defended the hosting.[336]  A number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[337][338] Issues regarding from human rights,[8][324] worker conditions ,the rights of LGBT fans,[324] and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.[339][340][341] In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.", "62]  Qatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup – the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32.

From that time on, court transcripts show, fears that Francis would bolt from home detention nagged the judge and prosecutors, alongside anxiety about how best to care for a critical witness in proceedings that were stretching for years. “I even went so far as to wonder if he is still in this country,” Sammartino commented at a 2020 hearing after Francis was discharged from a doctor’s care. Court transcripts at other times show the judge and attorneys discussing the need to take a deposition with Francis to preserve his testimony should he not survive  to help at trials. Details of his health had been shielded in closed-door hearings conducted since 2018.

Because of the redactions, the full extent of Francis’s medical condition and response to treatment still are difficult to discern. As the government prepared to release him on furlough, Sammartino said paying for constant security over months or years was too pricey for the government, leading to Francis’s hiring his own security staff.", "“I was so surprised to learn that this was being handled in the way it was,” Sammartino added, according to the transcript. “So that’s the only thing. It’s not a super big deal. But it needs to be taken care of.” Sammartino got another unwelcome surprise a year later when a podcast series featuring interviews with Francis boasting of how he reeled in the Navy was posted online. The leader of the project, Tom Wright, said he had podcast equipment delivered to Francis through one of his staffers. Joseph Mancano, a defense attorney for a retired Navy captain convicted in Francis’s scheme, said the episode illustrated how the government should have been more careful in its handling of Francis, particularly given how many people he had hoodwinked as part of his fraudulent business. He noted that Francis still owes the government $30 million in restitution. “Leonard Francis is a guy who will do whatever it takes to help himself,” Mancano said. “That’s how he’s lived his life.

He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents.

And as our new brand starts showing up in our products, I hope that people come to know the Meta brand and the future that we stand for. I used to love studying classics, and the word meta comes from the Greek word meaning “beyond”. For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build. There’s always a next chapter to the story.

That’s a notable step: it’s a tacit admission that VR headsets aren’t taking off as quickly as the company would like. Without a critical mass of people who understand what the metaverse feels like or even is, Meta can’t hope to have its products adopted.

The fine issued on Monday stems from an investigation started last year by Irish regulators into reports that Facebook had not safeguarded its platform against being “scraped” for information, leading to the publication on an online hacker forum of data that included users’ names, locations and birth dates, in violation of rules that require companies to safeguard personal information. Meta said in a statement that “unauthorized data scraping is unacceptable and against our rules.” The company said it had changed its policies to prevent such practices. Meta did not say whether it would appeal the decision, as it has for the Instagram and WhatsApp penalties. Meta is not the only tech giant facing scrutiny. Last year, Amazon was fined nearly €750 million over its online advertising practices by regulators in Luxembourg, where it has its European headquarters.

An investigation conducted by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) found the video-sharing app may have breached data protection law between May 2018 and July 2020. The ICO issued TikTok with a “notice of intent”, a precursor to handing down a potential fine, which could be up to £27m. If TikTok were to be fined this amount it would be the largest in the ICO’s history, exceeding the record £20m handed to British Airways two years ago after an incident in 2018 that saw the personal details of more than 400,000 customers compromised by hackers. The maximum fine the ICO can impose would be based on a calculation of 4% of TikTok’s global annual turnover. The regulator’s “provisional view” is that TikTok may have processed the data of children under the age of 13 without parental consent, and failed to provide proper information to its users in a “concise, transparent and easily understood way”. The ICO also said TikTok may have processed special category data – which includes ethnic and racial origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, trade union membership and genetic, biometric or health data – without legal grounds to do so.", "Facebook, in response to the letter, said at the time that the app \"helps parents and children to chat in a safer way,\" and emphasized that parents are \"always in control\" of their kids' activity.

The penalty, imposed by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, brings the fines that the regulator has imposed on Meta since last year to more than $900 million. In September, the same regulator fined the company roughly $400 million for its mistreatment of children’s data. In October last year, Irish authorities fined Meta, which was previously called Facebook, 225 million euros, or about $235 million, for violations related to its messaging service WhatsApp. The accumulating penalties will be a welcome sign to privacy groups that want to see European Union regulators more aggressively enforce the General Data Protection Regulation.

His first completed novel, Immaturity (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s.[6] He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879–80 and, as in Dublin, achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation.[26] Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.[27]  For the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother.[28] In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian.[6] He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox.[29][n 8] In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.[32][n 9]  In 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to \"search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race\".[35] Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself.", "4] If, as Holroyd and others surmise, George's motives were mercenary, then he was disappointed, as Bessie brought him little of her family's money.[5] She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband, with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of \"shabby-genteel poverty\".[4]  By the time of Shaw's birth, his mother had become close to George John Lee, a flamboyant figure well known in Dublin's musical circles. Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father;[6] there is no consensus among Shavian scholars on the likelihood of this.[7][8][9][10] The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother, but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply.[11] He found solace in the music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine mezzo-soprano voice and was much influenced by Lee's unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws' house was often filled with music, with frequent gatherings of singers and players.[2]  In 1862, Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an affluent part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay.", "20] Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.[6]  Early in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of tuberculosis.

He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.[2]  Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet.[2] Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London.[n 6] Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.[21][n 7]  Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing.[25] His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme.", "The mid-1880s marked a turning point in Shaw's life, both personally and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic.[55] He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior.[56] Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.[n 11]  The published novels, neither commercially successful, were his two final efforts in this genre: Cashel Byron's Profession written in 1882–83, and An Unsocial Socialist, begun and finished in 1883. The latter was published as a serial in To-Day magazine in 1884, although it did not appear in book form until 1887. Cashel Byron appeared in magazine and book form in 1886.[6]  In 1884 and 1885, through the influence of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw.", "12] Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly;[13] thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.[14]  Between 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated.[15][n 3] His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: \"Schools and schoolmasters\", he later wrote, were \"prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.\"[16] In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier.[6] During this period, Shaw was known as \"George Shaw\"; after 1876, he dropped the \"George\" and styled himself \"Bernard Shaw\".[n 4]  In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her.[6][n 5] Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten. Their two children remained in Britain.[56]  As George VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she visited Canada and Harry S. Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[57] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya. On 6 February, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[58] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name,[59] and was therefore called Elizabeth II. The numeral offended some Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland.[60] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.", "130] The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.[138]  In the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress in May 1991.[139]  On 24 November 1992, in a speech to mark the Ruby Jubilee of her accession to the throne, Elizabeth called 1992 her annus horribilis (a Latin phrase, meaning \"horrible year\").[140] Republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of Elizabeth's private wealth—contradicted by the Palace[d]—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[145] In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, separated from his wife, Sarah, and Mauritius removed Elizabeth as head of state; her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips in April;[146] angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at Elizabeth during a state visit to Germany in October;[147] and a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences, in November.

She oversaw the last throes of the British empire, weathered global upheaval and domestic scandal, and dramatically modernized the monarchy.           She lost Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years and the longest-serving consort in British history, in April last year.

After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly. There were questions about the monarchy's relevance in modern society.  \"No institution… should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't,\" she acknowledged. As a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service.

Though Alcaraz beat Nadal and Djokovic to win the Masters 1000 title on clay in Madrid this year, and reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, his best results so far in his short career have come on hardcourts. He reached the quarterfinals last year in his debut U.S. Open and reached the semifinal of the BNP Paribas Open in March before winning the Miami Open. He has an all-action style, and he frequently slides into near splits even on a hardcourt, a surface that allows him to make fast changes in direction and get the full benefit of his quickness. Sinner, who defeated Alcaraz in July in the fourth round at Wimbledon, repeatedly had to hit three or four terrific shots close to the lines to secure points as Alcaraz stretched and skidded to retrieve balls that would have escaped the reach of lesser talents.

Busch indicated on Sept. 1 at Cup Series Playoffs Media Day he had multiple offers to consider, and that the negotiation process had weighed on him. “Trust me, my gut doesn’t feel good, and that’s not just for decisions being made, but more so of decisions being weighed and the perception in how you come across to all of those that you’re going to disappoint, right?” Busch said at Media Day. “There’s going to be one winner, and the rest are not winners, if you look at it in that regard.” MORE: Biggest NASCAR free agent signings David Wilson, Toyota Racing Development president, had stressed the importance of keeping Busch in the automaker’s fold as discussions were ongoing, saying that “any other scenario is just unacceptable.” Busch ranks as Toyota’s top winner in all three NASCAR national series with 203 of his 224 total victories achieved during his time with the manufacturer. “I mean, Kyle Busch is our 60-home run hitter,” Wilson said Aug. 27 at Daytona International Speedway. “And we’d be foolish not to put everything in play to keep him in the family.” Joe Gibbs Racing and Toyota are now absorbing the loss of Busch’s looming departure from the heart of their batting order, and both groups will work to fill the vacancy.", "\"But more than that, Kyle has been a friend, part of our family and has played a key role in the development of many of our drivers through his ownership of Kyle Busch Motorsports. We wish nothing but the best for Kyle and his entire family as he moves into the next chapter of his Hall of Fame career. We're thankful to have been along for the ride.'' Childress said the atmosphere at his shop in Welcome has been electric since rumors started that Busch might move to the organization. He also said when he looks in Busch's eyes, he sees the same fiery look of competition he once saw in the late Dale Earnhardt. Earnhardt won six of his seven Cup championships driving for Childress. But RCR has not won a title since Earnhardt's final championship in 1994. Reddick, a two-race winner this season, is currently 11th in the playoff standings. Austin Dillon, Childress' grandson, won the regular-season finale to snag the final playoff spot, is 14th in the standings as the Cup Series heads into Saturday night's elimination race at Bristol Motor Speedway. It was Dillon, Childress said, who encouraged his grandfather to speak to Busch after Reddick blindsided RCR with his plans to leave in 2024. Busch goes into Bristol ranked 13th in the standings.", "Reddick will join 23XI in 2024. However, Busch has had a frosty relationship with RCR owner Richard Childress during his career. In 2011, Childress got into an altercation with Busch in the garage at Kansas Speedway that resulted in NASCAR fining Childress $150,000 and placing him on probation for the rest of the season. Asked at Kansas this past weekend how he could consider driving for Childress considering their history, Busch said: “The first time I sat down with him everything was OK and the biggest thing about it was just having the opportunity to put that behind us.” The inability of JGR to secure a primary sponsor and the lengthy negotiations leading to a new home for Busch in the Cup Series had taken a visible toll on the Las Vegas native in recent weeks. In an interview last month at Watkins Glen, Busch said whatever he decided “there’s a big change coming”. “Is it worth it to go run around and not have an opportunity to win right away versus building something versus jumping in something that can win? All those questions are certainly being weighed out,” he said then. “Again, that’s also why it’s not so simple and so easy. So, thankfully there are opportunities out there, here are Cup jobs available. But again, it will not look the same as what it has for the last 15 years.", "under caution during a 2011 Truck Series race at Texas Motor Speedway. He’s amassed several fines for his behavior including directing an obscene gesture at an official during a 2010 Cup race at Texas and for recklessly driving through the garage after crashing out of a 2021 playoff race at Darlington Raceway. Advertisement Busch’s sometimes brash behavior and outspokenness have made him a driver many fans dislike. He is frequently greeted with loud jeers during driver introductions and the same reception often greets him after he wins a race. Despite the trials and tribulations that Busch has put his team through, Joe Gibbs has maintained support for Busch throughout, and few expected that Busch would leave the organization owned by the three-time Super Bowl-winning head coach, NFL Hall of Famer and NASCAR Hall of Famer. JGR is one of NASCAR’s preeminent teams and can provide Busch the caliber of resources and equipment he needs to regularly contend for wins and championships. But as the sponsorship search stretched out, combined with Busch and JGR unable to come to terms on a new contract and Ty Gibbs’ continued emergence, the likelihood increased throughout the summer that Busch would end up leaving. He publicly acknowledged in late July that while his preference was to remain with JGR, he was speaking to other teams lest he would be left without a ride for the 2023 season.", "We put all of our differences behind us a while back and he’s a great race driver,” Childress said Aug. 28, after Dillon prevailed in the regular-season finale at Daytona. “He’ll land him a good ride somewhere, for sure.” RELATED: Kyle Busch through the years Busch joked about the long-ago fisticuffs last weekend at Kansas. “Who’s to say he hasn’t punched me again in any of these conversations?” Busch said to laughs. “Whenever you go into negotiations, it’s never fun so you’re duking the whole time. I think you grow up and you work through things, and you talk it over. Really, it was fine the first time I sat down with him. Everything was OK. The biggest thing about it was just having an opportunity to kind of put that behind us.” Kyle Busch qualified for the NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs with a victory earlier this year on the Bristol Motor Speedway dirt. That win in April extended his streak of seasons with at least one Cup Series victory to 18. Busch began his career as a Chevrolet prospect, joining the Cup Series full-time in 2005 with Hendrick Motorsports.

Meanwhile, there were no Asian female acting nominees at this year’s Emmys. “Women were missing again,” Wang Yuen said. “Where were Constance Wu, Lucy Liu and Mindy Kaling?” “Talent is not the problem,” she also said, “but, to paraphrase Viola Davis’s speech from a few years ago, the only thing that separates Asian/American actors from anyone else is opportunity; you cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.” Wang Yuen pioneered a study this year called “Tokens on the Small Screen: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Prime Time and Streaming Television.” Professors and scholars at six California universities surveyed 242 broadcast, cable and digital platform shows that aired during the 2015-2016 season."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

To convert prices while accounting for inflation, use our inflation calculator. You can also view inflation for specific goods & services or Consumer Price Index by year. This graph of historical inflation rates is generated using the average yearly value of inflation since 1913, as reported by the U.S. government Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This table shows the inflation rate on a monthly basis. The monthly and annual inflation rates are determined by computing the rate of change in Consumer Price Index over a trailing 12-month period. Below are the raw CPI values for each month. To compute inflation, start with the inflation rate formula:CPI in Y2 CPI in Y1 * Y1 USD value = Y2 USD value For example, if you wanted to convert dollar amounts in the year 2000 to dollar amounts in the year 2018:CPI in 2018 CPI in 2000 * 2000 USD value = 2018 USD valueNext, we plug in historical CPI values.

Calculating Annual Inflation Rates Annual rates of inflation are calculated using 12-month selections of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is published monthly by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To calculate the inflation rate for a specific month, such as January 2017, subtract the CPI for that month of the previous year (in this case, January 2016) from the current CPI (January 2017). The result is the difference between the two CPIs. Divide this number by the CPI for the previous year, then multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign to obtain the inflation rate for the given month. For example, to calculate the inflation rate for January 2017, subtract the January 2016 CPI of 236.916 from the January 2017 CPI of 242.839, which yields 5.923. Divide 5.923 by 236.916, multiply by 100, and add a % sign to obtain an inflation rate of 2.5% for January 2017.

Players explore the open world of Hyrule while they collect items and complete objectives such as puzzles or side quests.

The designers drew inspiration from Shadow of the Colossus (2005) and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011). Monolith Soft, known for their work on the open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography.  Breath of the Wild was first planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive. It was eventually released on March 3, 2017, as a launch game for the Switch and the final Nintendo game for the Wii U.

If “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Duality” turns out to be the real name for Breath of the Wild 2, it could confirm a popular fan request. Fans have wanted to play as Princess Zelda for years. Nintendo has almost given players their wishes in games like The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. However, the “Duality” could give gamers the chance to control the titular princess. “If real, it does make sense as to why Nintendo and Mr. Eiji Aonuma have been so hush-hush on the title,” Gale reports. “If fake or not final-yet-close to what the actual name ends up being, this still makes for an interesting topic to discuss.” Nintendo Treehouse’s Bill Trinen told IGN in 2021 why they kept the name so guarded. “As for why we’re holding back on the name, you’ll just have to stay tuned because, obviously, Zelda names are kind of important,” Trinen said. “Those subtitles … they start to give little bits of hints about maybe what’s going to happen.” The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, has an update to share about the launch timing of the sequel to The Legend of #Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Please take a look. pic.twitter.com/7OhayhiuM9", "‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2’ Theory Connects Link’s Arm to ‘Skyward Sword’ Spirits\t\t  Whatever the title for Breath of the Wild 2, Nintendo said fans would have to wait until Spring 2023 to see their favorite Zelda characters return.", "Despite Nintendo staying tight lipped about its upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel, fans and 'insiders' have been busy guessing its potential title. Ever since Nintendo announced its sequel to 2017’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, several titles for the upcoming RPG have been leaked; however so far none have gone on to show even a glimmer of accuracy. Nintendo first announced that a sequel to Breath of the Wild was in development all the way back in 2019 at an E3 Nintendo Direct presentation. During this presentation, fans were treated to a dark and mysterious trailer that showed Link and Princess Zelda as they travelled through a murky underground dungeon to the corpse of Ganondorf. The corpse soon reanimates itself and grabs the Hero of Time as waves of ghostly light are emitted all around them. Since that particular Breath of the Wild 2 announcement, fans have heard no more about it from Nintendo. Instead, Nintendo revealed Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity out of the blue in September 2020, with the Dynasty Warriors-spin off releasing shortly after in November. The news of Age of Calamity made it the first time in the Zelda franchise’s history that both a prequel and sequel for one game were in production at the same time."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Later, in a December interview, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser added that the contents of the game would be shown when they felt they had enough to show.[8]  The second trailer and first gameplay showcase aired on June 15th, 2021, during the E3 2021 Nintendo Direct.[9] A portion of gameplay was shown, featuring a number of abilities and the new world of Hyrule. An estimated release date for the game was also announced to be sometime during 2022.  On March 29, 2022, Nintendo released a video where Eiji Aonuma announced that development time had been extended, with the game being set to release in the spring of 2023. A short gameplay clip was premiered that showcased Link's new outfit and a heavily damaged Master Sword.[3]", "In order to restore the Master Sword and bring it to Link, she swallows her secret stone and undergoes a process known as draconification, becoming the Light Dragon.  In the present, after ridding the Great Deku Tree from gloom in Korok Forest, Link retrieves the Master Sword from the Light Dragon and goes to confront Ganondorf below Hyrule Castle. With the aid of Sidon, Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, and Mineru, Link battles an army of monsters before engaging in combat with Ganondorf himself. Nearing defeat, Ganondorf swallows his secret stone and becomes the Demon Dragon, taking Link into the skies above Hyrule. With the assistance of the Light Dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the Demon Dragon's secret stone, killing it. Aided by the spirits of Rauru and Sonia, Link turns the Light Dragon back into Zelda and regains his original right arm. Rauru and Sonia fade away, and Link and Zelda fall to the surface below, where they reunite.  Some time later, on the Great Sky Island, Mineru bids goodbye to Zelda and Link before fading away, while the sages vow to protect Hyrule.  Development of Tears of the Kingdom started in 2017 after Breath of the Wild was completed. Initially, new ideas were thought of for DLC but eventually it evolved into a new game when too many were gathered.", "16]  According to the review aggregators Metacritic (96/100) and OpenCritic (97%), Tears of the Kingdom received \"universal acclaim\".[17][18]        Tears of the Kingdom has currently sold over 10 million copies during it's first week, making it the 2nd best-selling game in the series, right behind Breath of the Wild (with over 30 million copies sold).[20] It is currently the second-best selling game of 2023.[21]      The Legend of Zelda  · The Adventure of Link  · A Link to the Past (& Four Swords)  · Link's Awakening (DX; Nintendo Switch)  · Ocarina of Time (Master Quest; 3D)  · Majora's Mask (3D)  · Oracle of Ages  · Oracle of Seasons  · Four Swords (Anniversary Edition)  · The Wind Waker (HD)  · Four Swords Adventures  · The Minish Cap  · Twilight Princess (HD)  · Phantom Hourglass  · Spirit Tracks  · Skyward Sword (HD)  · A Link Between Worlds  · Tri Force Heroes  · Breath of the Wild  · Tears of the Kingdom", "99 / £109.99.

The service ended with two minutes of silence observed across the United Kingdom, after which the attendees sang the national anthem, now titled “God Save the King.” The day began early when the doors of Parliament’s 900-year-old Westminster Hall were closed to mourners after hundreds of thousands had filed in front of her coffin.  Monday was declared a public holiday in honor of Elizabeth, who died Sept. 8 — and hundreds of thousands of people descended on central London to witness history.

The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.", "Two days before her death, on 6 September 2022, the Queen accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson and appointed Liz Truss to succeed him as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; these meetings took place at Balmoral Castle, rather than their usual location, Buckingham Palace.[22] At the meeting with Truss, the final public photos of the Queen were taken by Jane Barlow. Social media users were quick to observe the Queen’s continued use of a walking stick, her frail, “ghostly” appearance, and a large bruise-like mark on her right hand. After the Queen’s death, Barlow said that while she could tell the Queen was unwell, she was “in quite good spirits.” On 7 September, the Queen was scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24]  The Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign.

The queen's piper played a lament on a bagpipe, which was followed by a blessing by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the singing of the national anthem. \"Go forth into the world in peace; Be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil; strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honor all people, love and serve the Lord, rejoicing in the power of the Holy Spirit; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit be among you and remain with you always.

Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.", "Italy has had all sorts of leaders — including Silvio Berlusconi, with his politics-as-theater approach to governing (and who six years ago discouraged a pregnant Meloni from running for mayor of Rome, saying a “mother cannot be mayor”). Meloni is hardly the first to relish political combat. But some Italians worry she’ll further polarize the country and loosen some of the restraints in society. Edith Bruck, a Holocaust survivor and poet who lives in Rome, and who has befriended Pope Francis, noted Meloni’s shorthand way for introducing herself: as a woman, a mother, an Italian and a Christian. “What is the implication of that?” Bruck said. “That she isn’t Muslim or Jewish? It all goes back to the idea that Europe is Christian and non-Christians are a threat.” Meloni’s allies see it differently. Giovanbattista Fazzolari, a Brothers of Italy senator who has known Meloni since she was a teenager, said Meloni would represent the whole country, but that there could be “exceedingly hard” clashes with entrenched powers that she judges aren’t working “for the good of the nation.” On the campaign trail, Meloni has dealt with mostly adoring crowds, plus the occasional protest group chanting “fascists” at her supporters. And she’s used even the off-script moments as evidence that she’s ready for the job.", "“I cannot say that, faced with such a responsibility, my hands aren’t shaking,” she said. “Because we’d find ourselves governing Italy during what’s perhaps one of the most complex situations ever.” Meloni’s ascent owes something to the fading star of another far-right politician, Matteo Salvini. Salvini, as recently as several years ago, was seen as Italy’s political dynamo — holding raucous rallies, banning the docking of immigrant ships and echoing former president Donald Trump with his pledge to put “Italians first.” From his perch as interior minister in 2018 and 2019, Salvini dominated the national discourse, and his League party had grown so popular that he thought he could vault into the prime minister’s seat. But his plan backfired. When he broke apart his government coalition to force new elections, other parties joined hands to freeze him out. He tumbled into the opposition. He lunged for new ways to stand out and contradicted himself with shifting positions. Eventually, Salvini took his party back into government, supporting former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, the embodiment of the European establishment. “Salvini had won the lottery ticket,” said Giovanni Orsina, director of the school of government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. “Then he lost it and Meloni got it.” Even those who disagree with Meloni’s politics concede that she strategized wisely.", "30] She was the second youngest-ever minister in the history of united Italy.[31] In August 2008, she invited Italian athletes to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in disagreement with the Chinese policy implemented towards Tibet; this statement was criticised by Berlusconi, as well as the foreign affairs minister Franco Frattini.[32] In 2009, her party merged with Forza Italia (FI) into The People of Freedom (PdL) and she took over the presidency of the united party's youth section, called Young Italy.[31] In the same year, she voted in favour of a decree law against euthanasia.[33]  In November 2010, on behalf of the ministry, she presented a 300 million euro package called the Right to the Future. It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]", "Heading into the 2022 Italian general election, a snap election that was called after the 2022 Italian government crisis,[78][79] it was agreed among the centre-right coalition that the leader of the party receiving the most votes would be put forward as the prime minister candidate.[80] As of July 2022, FdI was the first party in the coalition according to opinion polling,[81][82] and she was widely expected to become Prime Minister of Italy if the centre-right coalition obtained an absolute majority in Parliament, which would be the most right-wing government in the history of the Italian Republic according to some academics.[83] In an attempt to moderate herself to placate fears among those who describe FdI as neo-fascist or far right,[84] including fears within the European Commission that she could lead Italy towards Hungary under Viktor Orbán,[85] Meloni told the foreign press that Italian fascism is history. As president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020,[86] she said she shared the experiences and values of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, Likud in Israel, and the Republican Party in the United States.[87] Critics were sceptical of her claims, citing her speeches on immigration and LGBT rights.[88][89] She campaigned for lower taxes, less European bureaucracy, and a halt to immigration through a naval blockade,[90][91] saying she would put national interests first.[92][93][94]"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

This was far from his best game but it was entirely fitting that he would be heavily involved in the goal which ended 64 years of hurt. A positive move to be included from the start given his aerial prowess in both boxes. Won the first ball to set up Bale in a show of his qualities from a direct approach. Regularly penalised as so often big strikers are, but was unfazed by the Spanish official's pedantry. Selflessly set up Ramsey's chance minutes after the restart.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies. His HBO special “Rothaniel,” in which he came out as gay, won an Emmy and was considered among the best of 2022.", "Appearing recently on NBC’s “Tonight Show,” Carmichael took aim at the network as well as the awards show, and said it was his idea — along with NBC’s “lazy and pushy” marketing team — to brand the ceremony as an “evening of joy and devastation.”  Awards  The best looks from the 2023 Golden Globes, including Ana de Armas, Viola Davis and Jenna Ortega.   Announcing the nominees last month, the HFPA recognized the films “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and TV series “Abbott Elementary” and “The White Lotus,” among others. Below are the projects that have been tapped in the major categories, taken from the complete list of 2023 nominees: Best motion picture — drama Best motion picture — musical or comedy Television series — drama Television series — musical or comedy  Awards  The Globes return to TV this year after a hiatus sparked by a Times investigation into the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. Here are the nominees.   Given Hollywood’s aloof response to the nominations, it’s almost surprising how many stars have agreed to come out for the glittery affair. The HFPA has announced a substantial list of presenters, many of whom are nominated, ramping up the star power for the telecast.  Meanwhile, actor and comedian Eddie Murphy will be given the 2023 Cecil B.", "Best Actor - Motion Picture - Drama ... HFPA/GG will store your name and email address and use them to send the Weekly Globe newsletter. Withdraw consent by ...", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The company shared full details about it during its Made by Google event in New York City today (Google's first in-person hardware event since the pandemic). The smartwatch debuted alongside the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones, which you can read about here.  There's been a steady drip of news about the Pixel Watch since Google teased it back in May at its I/O developer conference, but you probably want to know what it costs more than anything. The Pixel Watch costs $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $399 if you want the version with cellular capability. That is $50 less and $100 less than the equivalent models of the Apple Watch Series 8.

Some details, like unique Fitbit integration and a minimalist design, knocked it out of the park. Others, like disappointing battery life, rang up short.

Stay tuned to hear everything we know about the Google Pixel Watch 2 and find out what features we are most hopeful to see for the search giant’s next attempt. Ever since the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 series, the Wear OS landscape has been an exciting market to watch. Samsung kept its foot on the gas with the Galaxy Watch 5, and other companies, such as Fossil, have scrambled to keep up. When the first Pixel Watch finally landed in the fray, we accepted Google’s smartwatch as an imperfect but promising first attempt.", "There hasn’t been much leaked so far, and matters are complicated by the fact that Jon Prosser has reported Google is in fact working on two models: a standard Pixel Watch 2 and a separate version for kids, though he admits that this latter might end up being released under the Fitbit brand, perhaps as a follow-up to 2021’s Fitbit Ace 3. The only other big news so far regards the chip inside the watch. 9to5Google cites unnamed sources who claim that the Pixel Watch will be powered by one of the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 chips, meaning a switch away from the Samsung Exynos chip used in the first generation. The biggest impact of the shift is likely to be on battery life, with the site reporting that Google is now aiming for more than a day’s battery life with the always-on display enabled – a big jump, considering the first gen could only just last 24 hours without the always-on display. The battery could also be boosted by software improvements, given that we’re expecting the Pixel Watch 2 to be the first watch to launch with Wear OS 4, which Google has already teased will include battery life improvements and a more colourful user interface based on Material You. Aside from that, it’s been pretty thin on the ground.

He was the longest-serving prime minister in Japan's history. Known to be a hardline conservative within his conservative political party, Abe served as chief cabinet secretary from 2005 to 2006 under Junichiro Koizumi. He was then elected president of the LDP before becoming Japan's prime minister in 2006 at the age of 52 -- the country's youngest premier since World War II. Abe served as the Japanese prime minister from 2006 to 2007 and then again from 2012 to 2020, before stepping down due to chronic health issues. He later revealed he was being treated for ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal disease. Some of Abe's actions and policies, including his visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine to honor World War II criminals and laws that were passed during his time in office allowing the Japan Self-Defense Forces to participate in wars alongside allies overseas, had strained relationships with neighboring nations. He was also a strong vocal critic of China, as he sided with Taiwan's desire to be recognized as a democratic, independent state. Abe was the first foreign leader to meet former U.S. President Donald Trump after Trump was elected in 2016.", "Commentators have said that his legacy pushed Japan towards more proactive military spending, security, and economic policies.[citation needed] Shinzo Abe was born on 21 September 1954 to a prominent political family in Shinjuku, Tokyo.[2] Although as a boy he aspired to become a filmmaker, Abe's family history led him upon a political path.[3] His father Shintaro Abe served in the House of Representatives from 1958 to 1991, with stints as Chief Cabinet Secretary, Minister for International Trade and Industry, and Minister for Foreign Affairs. During World War II, Shintaro volunteered to be a kamikaze pilot but the war ended before he completed training.[4]  Abe's maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was the de facto \"economic king\" of occupied China and Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state in Northern China established after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II.[5][6] During the war, Kishi served as Vice Minister of Munitions in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo.[7] At the end of the war, Kishi was imprisoned as a suspected \"Class-A\" war criminal by the US military occupation of Japan, but was released and later de-purged as part of the Occupation's \"reverse course\" due to the Cold War.", "Harris said, “he did not succeed in the kind of transformation that he wanted to achieve.” But even after he stepped down as prime minister, Mr. Abe continued to wield considerable influence from behind the scenes. His handpicked successor Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe’s chief cabinet secretary, succeeded him when he resigned. When Mr. Suga was forced from office, Mr. Abe supported Sanae Takaichi, 60, a hard-line conservative, to be Japan’s first female prime minister. When she did not gain enough votes in a first round of party voting, Mr. Abe supported the eventual victor, Fumio Kishida, a moderate establishment pick, in order to prevent one of his chief rivals, Taro Kono, a former foreign and defense minister, from winning. He could still draw enormous attention by floating controversial ideas, such as a proposal that Japan host American nuclear weapons. And as the Liberal Democrats campaigned for an upcoming Upper House election, Mr. Abe’s long-cherished hope to revise the Constitution remained a key plank in their platform. Mr. Abe is survived by his wife, Akie Abe; his mother, Yoko Abe; and his brothers: Nobuo Kishi, Japan’s defense minister, and Hironobu Abe, who retired in March as the chief executive of Mitsubishi Corporation Packaging. In a speech in August 2020 to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, Mr.", "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his “deepest condolences” to former leader Abe, saying he “was a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time.”           Kishida said he had a “great respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind” and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs.           News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.

Moon was a self-declared messiah and ardent anti-communist.[22]  Nobusuke Kishi's postwar political agenda led him to work closely with Ryoichi Sasakawa, a businessman and nationalist politician during the Second World War.", "186] Sayuri Ogawa, who was invited to spectate the parliamentary session when the bills were being passed, was grateful of the new laws to be made in such a tight schedule of the parliament, but she also stressed that there are still many challenges ahead [surrounding the UC and its victims] with the most pressing one being passing new bill protecting children from religious abuse;[188] Lawyer Hiroshi Yamaguchi who represents Zenkoku Benren wished that there would have been more time to make a solid bill. He worried that under the new laws it would still be difficult to prove that the claimant's free will was being suppressed when accepting the transaction, also the definition of what allows the victim's child or spouse to demand restitution on behalf of their relative was too narrow to be practical.[186][183][189]  In the afternoon of 11 July, Abe's casket was transported to the Zōjō Temple in Shiba Park of the Minato ward of Tokyo, where several feudal shoguns are buried.[190][191] A wake for Abe began at 6:00 p.m.[190] Over 2,500 people attended, according to the LDP.[192]  A Buddhist funeral for Abe took place at Zōjō Temple on the next day.

He also was a prominent figure on the world stage, cultivating strong ties with Washington and seeking better relations with Beijing – while also trying to counter Chinese expansion in the region by uniting Pacific allies.           One of his final successes in office was securing the 2020 Tokyo Olympics – though the Covid-19 pandemic forced the competition to be postponed to 2021.           After stepping down in 2020, citing health reasons, Abe remained active in politics, often campaigning for his party – which is what he was doing at the time of his assassination.            NHK reported in July that the suspected shooter, Tetsuya Yamagami, had targeted the former Prime Minister because he believed Abe’s grandfather – another former Japanese leader – had helped the expansion of a religious group he held a grudge against.           CNN has not been able to independently confirm what group Yamagami was referring to, or links between Abe and any group the suspect harbored hatred towards.

At a protest on Monday against the funeral, thousands of people gathered in Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo and raised multicolored flags representing a cornucopia of causes: women’s empowerment, disability rights, L.G.B.T.Q. allegiance and opposition to nuclear power or American military bases. “I think that it’s important for all of us to get together like this and express our feelings,” said Shuhei Sato, 42, who stood out in the rain. “What Abe did, what he stood for, everybody he hurt — it is not OK.” Internationally, Mr. Abe earned praise for his early success in jump-starting Japan’s moribund economy, his hosting of President Barack Obama in the first American presidential visit to Hiroshima and his adroit handling of a mercurial President Donald J. Trump. He also helped hold together a sweeping multinational trade agreement intended as a bulwark against China even after Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from it. At home, his reputation was cloudier.", "Abe was cremated in July following a private funeral at a Tokyo temple days after he was assassinated while giving a campaign speech on a street in Nara in western Japan. Tokyo was under high security for the state funeral, especially near the venue, the Budokan martial arts hall. At a protest in downtown Tokyo, thousands of people marched toward the hall, some banging drums and many shouting or holding banners and signs stating their opposition. “Shinzo Abe has not done a single thing for regular people,” participant Kaoru Mano said. Kishida has also been criticized because of a widening controversy over decades of close ties between Abe and the governing Liberal Democratic Party with the Unification Church, accused of raking in huge donations by brainwashing adherents. The suspect in Abe’s assassination reportedly told police he killed Abe because of his links to the church, which he said took large amounts of money from his mother, bankrupting his family and ruining his life. “The fact that the close ties between the LDP and the Unification Church may have interfered with policymaking processes is seen by the Japanese people as a greater threat to democracy than Abe’s assassination,” Hosei University political science professor Jiro Yamaguchi wrote in a recent article.

Certain writers from various online articles have noted that their own Northern Irish family appreciated the way the show gave an honest portrayal of how life was for teens in the Troubles, and how much was endured by families during that time.[46] The way it portrayed the events and circumstances with a sense of normality echoed the real lives of both Protestants and Catholics in that area.[46]  Lisa McGee based events in the programme on her own life, such as writing a letter to the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea.[47] Adding real stories such as this to the episodes grounded the show in a way that allowed viewers to connect with the teenage attitudes of the characters, and served as a stark contrast to the events around them.", "And if that isn't enough for you, every episode of season 1 and 2 are streaming on All4 now. So you can enjoy loads more joyous and emotional moments like the one below...  Writer Lisa McGee has confirmed that season 3 will be the gang's last outing. She released a full statement on Twitter, saying: \"It was always the plan to say goodbye after three series. \"Derry Girls is a coming of age story; following five ridiculous teenagers as they slowly... very slowly... start to become adults, while around them the place they call home starts to change too and Northern Ireland enters a new more hopeful phase - which was a small, magical window of time. It has been an honour to write it and I will forever be proud of everything it's achieved. \"Who knows if Erin, Clare, Orla, Michelle and James will return in some other guise someday, but for now this is it for us.\" Derry Girls is set in the 90s during The Troubles in Derry, with tributes to the era's fashion and music providing the backdrop. Most of the series was filmed in Derry, with some scenes also shot in Belfast. Hunterhouse College and New Barnsley Park in Belfast, and Limewood Street in Derry, were among the locations. Lisa McGee is the creator and writer of Derry Girls.", "Nicola took to Insta to post a cute Polaroid selfie with co-star Louisa Harland, who plays Orla McCool on the show. She placed two rainbow pin badges next to the sweet pic, in what appears to be a heartfelt reference to lesbian character Claire.  The actress went on to add the caption, \"Goodbye Derry Girls, it’s been quite a ride 🌈,\" seeming to confirm that filming has indeed finished. We're not crying, you're crying.  Filming for Derry Girls season 3 was originally supposed to start in June 2020, but was delayed due to the pandemic. However, on 1 November 2021, Nicola shared another Instagram post featuring a behind-the-scenes snap from set, appearing to make the start of production. Posting a very close-up selfie complete with her character Claire's signature fringe and scrunchie pigtails, Nicola wrote, \"Guess who’s back in the house #ReturnOfTheWeeLesbian\" - in reference to the season 1 episode which saw Claire come out as a lesbian.  While it wasn't 100% clear whether filming had properly started, Nicola certainly seemed to be in costume (hey, maybe she just likes to dress up at home to get into character).   While Nicola Coughlan has confirmed that she's returning as Claire, the rest of the main cast will remain the same too.", "The series is set in the 1990s, and follows the exploits of five teenagers: Erin Quinn (Jackson), Erin's cousin Orla (Harland), friends Clare (Coughlan) and Michelle (O'Donnell), and Michelle's cousin James (Llewellyn). The teens balance the struggles of being teenagers, exploring strange and absurd situations, and attending school during the end of the Troubles, a time of conflict and sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. As well as archival footage of politicians, Derry Girls references events from the Troubles, such as the announcement of the IRA ceasefire, President Bill Clinton's 1995 visit to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday referendum (which marked the end of the Troubles).

In 2009, the Nobel Prize was awarded to Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol W.

The last classical physiology laureates were John Eccles, Alan Hodgkin, and Andrew Huxley in 1963 for their findings regarding \"unitary electrical events in the central and peripheral nervous system.\"[20]  A Medicine or Physiology Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[21] These are awarded during the prize ceremony at the Stockholm Concert Hall.  The Physiology and Medicine medal has a portrait of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse.[22] The medal was designed by Erik Lindberg.[22] The reverse of the medal depicts the 'Genius of Medicine holding an open book in her lap, collecting the water pouring out from a rock in order to quench a sick girl's thirst'.", "Subsequently, those selecting the recipients have exercised wide latitude in determining what falls under the umbrella of Physiology or Medicine. The awarding of the prize in 1973 to Nikolaas Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch for their observations of animal behavioural patterns could be considered a prize in the behavioural sciences rather than medicine or physiology.[14] Tinbergen expressed surprise in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech at \"the unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award this year's prize 'for Physiology or Medicine' to three men who had until recently been regarded as 'mere animal watchers'\".[44]  Laureates have been awarded the Nobel Prize in a wide range of fields that relate to physiology or medicine.

This wording change satisfies the original intention of the gradual scale points system when it was introduced in 2022.[17]  The deployment and position of the recovery vehicle on the track was criticised after AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly narrowly missed the vehicle due to poor visibility, angrily remonstrated that \"[he] could have killed [himself]\" if he had lost control and hit the vehicle, even at reduced speed.[18] Gasly also attacked the deployment as \"disrespectful\" to the memory and family of his childhood friend Jules Bianchi, who suffered fatal injuries at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix when he crashed into a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit. Bianchi's godson Charles Leclerc also said that the sport should learn from Bianchi's death and not have similar issues in the future, and Bianchi's father wrote on Instagram that the race officials had \"no respect\" for either the life of the drivers or Bianchi's memory.

Adrianna Tomaz was born in Kahndaq at the time the country was under military occupation by foreign forces.

As a mother, Tomaz cares about her son, trying to teach him values such as patience and not wanting Adam to teach him to be violent, even giving the Crown of Sabbac to Gregor in order to save him.  During her classes, Tomaz showed that it was important to conserve even the worst relics in history, explaining that inaction against to outside influences can cause societies to languish and die, and that she would not give up on Kahndaq as she believed her people could be resourceful.

As Tomaz was leaving, she was interrupted by Nelson who asked her to check her bag, getting upset with the Society for wanting to defeat Adam, berating them for not helping them when they were under coups for several years, claiming that Adam was a hero for saving the people of Kahndaq from repression and claiming not to have the Crown, but Hawkman explained that Adam was not a hero, which Tomaz did not believe, allowing them to check his bag without the Crown.

The Amulet of Isis had long ago belonged to another of the wizard Shazam's champions, Queen Pharoah Hatshepsut of the 15th Dynasty, who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom. Upon Hatshepsut's death the amulet became dormant.  Upon holding the amulet and speaking \"I am Isis\", Adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. She and Adam then began traveling the Middle East and freeing enslaved children, hoping to find Isis' kidnapped brother. In Week Sixteen of the series, Adam proposes to Isis and the two are wed by Captain Marvel, with several other Marvel Family members (Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., Tawky Tawny the tiger and Uncle Dudley) present as members of the wedding party.

Therefore, the price of the RTX 4090 GPU is $1,600.", "docs": ["Comparing the RTX 4090 to the RTX 4080 reveals a flaw in Nvidia’s pricing plan for this generation — the numbers just don’t add up. If you look at the RTX 4080 alone, regardless of the price, it is a really good graphics card. It outperforms every GPU from the previous generation, including the RTX 3090 Ti, by a considerable amount. The sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what gamers truly think. It’s also around 30% slower than the RTX 4090 while only being 25% cheaper, and this is where things get complicated, because, at MSRP, the RTX 4090 is a much better deal than the 4080 — even if it’s more expensive. It offers much better performance per dollar, which historically hasn’t been the case. The flagships were aimed at enthusiasts who didn’t try to get the best deal; they just wanted the best performance. Take one step down from the top and the good deals start, where the performance is still great but the price is less ridiculous. That hasn’t been true in this generation, and the sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what Nvidia’s customers think about this. Every time a new GPU drops, scalpers can be counted on to buy it en masse and then throw it up on eBay at a huge markup.", "Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It’s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.", "In short — the RTX 4080 seems to have done the 4090 a favor. It made an overpriced GPU suddenly appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia’s plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080? Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable prices — $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal — but only if you can make use of it. If you’re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons. Personally, I’m still waiting for the 7900 XTX, and judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080, I really have no regrets.", "Now, we’re seeing some SKUs, such as premium cooling models get slight discounts, presumably in an effort to get the pricey GPU off of the shelves.  The RTX 4090 will not be the fastest Lovelace-based GPU that Nvidia will release, it is going to use a cut-down version of the AD102, the best chip. Nvidia will also be saving the full-fat version later down the line. The reason why companies usually start on the highest-end of cards is that they are able to then do something named “chip binning”. So, if a chip is made and doesn’t quite cut the mustard to become 4090, then it might be put into a pile for use later in life as an RTX 4080 Ti later down the line. We’ve also seen rumors of an RTX 4090 Ti begin to circulate. But, those are just rumors for now. You certainly will not be disappointed if you pick one up and your CPU is more than up to the task of keeping up with a behemoth of a GPU such as this.  It’s important to note that we are talking about the desktop-class RTX 4090. For laptops, the RTX 4090 is actually similar in performance to an RTX 4070 Ti, though it comes slightly shy of being as powerful as the desktop-class GPU.", "It seems that Nvidia’s customers are aware of this if you look at the large number of 4080s that the scalpers can’t seem to make a profit on. Newegg actually made 4080s non-refundable, seemingly because too many scalpers wanted to get rid of their cards.

Wccftech’s Hassan Mujtaba claims that the 4080 initially shipped in much smaller numbers than the 4090 — 30,000 units versus 130,000. If this is true, and the 4080 is still laying around at MSRP, then the community has truly spoken — people just don’t want those decent, but questionably priced RTX 4080s.

It’s also water-resistant up to 50 meters and dust-resistant.           The closest thing you could compare the Pixel Watch to is a silky-smooth stone from a river. It’s really stunning. It goes against the design language of the Apple Watch, which historically has been a squircle and likely will remain that way for a while. On the other hand, the Pixel Watch is round like many other Wear OS smartwatches, but it’s by far the most beautiful of the bunch.           The size it comes in feels like a good middle ground. It’s not too small where it looks weird on larger wrists, yet it’s not too big to hang off of smaller wrists. It’s a tad bigger than the 41mm Apple Watch, which feels right for a watch that comes in a single size.           There’s a crown on the right side that can be rotated to sift through the user interface, and a button sits above it to give you quick access to recent apps.

The case comes in one size—41 millimeters—and is made of 80 percent recycled stainless steel. Off the bat, that makes the Pixel Watch more durable than most smartwatches, which are usually crafted out of aluminum. It comes in matte black, polished silver, or champagne gold. (Each Pixel Watch also comes with Google's Active band, but more on straps in a minute.) It's the glass protecting the AMOLED screen that makes this smartwatch look unique. It's domed and bends the light, not unlike a Junghans Max Bill. It's very elegant, but it also looks fragile. It doesn't help that Google is using Corning's Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the display instead of a sapphire crystal, which offers more scratch resistance. However, Sandeep Waraich, director of product management for Pixel Watch, says over the years the team has put the watch through its paces and is confident in its durability (though he doesn't recommend using it for rugged sports like rock climbing).

With a background in environmental sustainability and social justice, how do you think Prospect Park can be a both thought and action leader in these areas?   I think it’s important to start from a place of seeing sustainability and social justice as symbiotic. Sustainability is not just a luxury that gets added on top, but is deeply integrated into the work we do as a society to promote equity and social justice. I see access to open space as one of the core pillars, among others such as education, housing, health and safety, that help transition people from surviving to thriving. Over the past two years in particular, we’ve seen how important the park has been for our  health and wellbeing. I want to work with our talented team, as well as our community, to continue to lean into that and think about more opportunities for New Yorkers to access health services in the park.", "Earlier in her career, Monaco served two tenures at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, first as Director of the MillionTreesNYC Initiative and later as Director of Stewardship for Forestry, Horticulture and Natural Resources.

Well, it has been five months since it was released and it is safe to assume Sony has already started the process of making a PC version.", "69] Writing for PCMag, Clay Halton was more critical of the system, stating it was the game's \"most tedious aspect\", as it can be difficult to determine which weapon or armor piece needs upgraded. He also noted this was an issue in the prior game, but it was more complicated in the sequel.[78]  The environments were also well-praised for their sense of scale and the changes to returning locations. Hussain praised the changes as not only did they show the effects of Fimbulwinter, but they provided new areas to explore.[73] Tapsell shared similar sentiments and said that the realms were more varied and more inviting, and also said that the sense of scale that was missing in the 2018 installment was resolved in Ragnarök.[70] Halton said that although there is not a noticeable difference from the prior game, largely due to Ragnarök releasing on both the PS4 and PS5, the game is still beautiful, saying that each realm and their respective environments are \"thoughtfully crafted\".[78]  The PlayStation 5 version of God of War Ragnarök was the third bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 29,377 physical copies being sold.

God of War Ragnarok is official – for a long time, the name of the game was assumed, and the rumour mill was working hard to try and dissuade fans that Ragnarok would indeed be the final suffix for the title. The game is already making some big promises: developer Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has promised that the incoming game will complete the Norse storyline from the 2018 game, God of War… so you know the stakes are going to be high. Fan appetite for the game is clearly quite high, too: God Of War Ragnarok currently has the most views of all the trailers released at the last Sony PlayStation Showcase that took place on September 9, 2021. Given that most of those trailers are well into the muiti-million hit-count, that’s impressive. God of War: Ragnarok currently sits at over 12million views. Whoever said that fan desire for Sony exclusives was on the decrease? The game will carry on more or less straight from the previous title, with Kratos and Atreus venturing once more into the ancient Norse world, attempting to put a halt to that eponymous world-ending Ragnarok.

The most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the Earldom of Attlee was created, subsequent to the death of Earl Baldwin in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remains the case as of 2023.  All former prime ministers are entitled to claim for salary or office expenses incurred in fulfilling public duties in that role. The allowance may not be used to pay for private or parliamentary duties. It is administered by the Cabinet Office Finance Team.  The maximum amount which may be claimed per year is £115,000, plus 10% towards any staff pension costs. This limit is reviewed annually, and at the start of each Parliament, by the Prime Minister. The maximum level may be adjusted downwards if the former prime minister receives any public funds for fulfilling other  public appointments.[45]  All lists: Category:Lists of prime ministers of the United Kingdom", "citation needed] The prime minister's authority was further enhanced by the Parliament Act 1911, which marginalised the influence of the House of Lords in the law-making process.[citation needed]  The prime minister is the head of the United Kingdom government.[9] As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation.[10]  In the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of His Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.[11]  Charles III    William, Prince of Wales    Charles III(King-in-Council)", "Before the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position. Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers (the prime minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected House of Commons.  Although many of the sovereign's prerogative powers are still legally intact,[n 1] constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise and to warn.[16][17]  In modern times, much of the process involving prime ministerial appointments is informally governed by constitutional conventions and authoritative sources, like The Cabinet Manual, paragraphs 2.7 to 2.20 and 3.1 to 3.2.  The prime minister is appointed by the monarch, through the exercise of the royal prerogative.[18] In the past, the monarch has used personal choice to dismiss or appoint a prime minister (the last time being in 1834), but it is now the case that they should not be drawn into party politics.[4]: 2.9.   The prime minister \"...", "Sunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.

Given that Netflix is available in more than 190 countries, we’d expect Netflix Standard with Ads to debut in many more territories in the months ahead. Netflix lost subscribers during the first and second quarters of 2022, ending a decade of growth and sending Netflix’s stock price into a tailspin. And while Netflix is ubiquitous in North America, it’s having trouble gaining traction in the rest of the world, where it’s facing tough competition from cheaper streaming services. Meanwhile, Netflix’s rapidly growing competitors, including HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, and Hulu, all have–or are preparing to roll out–their own cheaper ad-supported plans, all of which currently undercut Netflix’s cheapest ad-free plans. So while it wasn’t all that long ago that Netflix executives scoffed at the idea of cheaper ad-supported plans, the company abruptly changed course once it became clear that its once seemingly unstoppable growth had stalled.

Among the missing movies are Skyfall, 28 Days, The Imitation Game, and The Bad Guys. That’s starting to change, however. As of March 2023, The Crown was available for streaming on Netflix with ads, among other previously unavailable titles. If you do run across a video that’s unavailable on the Netflix Standard with Ads plan, you’ll see a padlock on the title, or a “Change plan to watch” banner in place of the standard “Play” button. One of the best perks offered by the big streamers is the ability to download their videos for offline viewing, perfect for binge-watching your favorite series during a long flight or when you don’t want to bust through your data cap. Unfortunately–but not surprisingly–Netflix won’t let Standard with Ads subscribers download videos for offline viewing. Indeed, the practice of streamers barring with-ads users from downloading videos is pretty much the norm, and that includes Paramount+, which is otherwise fairly liberal with its ad-supported features.  Besides the U.S.", "Same as Netflix, most other streamers reserve their 4K HDR streams for their ad-free subscribers, although that’s not a universal policy; Paramount+, for one, does allow ad-supported subscribers to stream in 4K. Netflix Standard with Ads subscribers will have to sit through 4-5 minutes of commercials per hour, with the ads running at the beginning and during videos. Each ad will be either 15 or 30 seconds. That 4-5 minute per hour figure is pretty much in line with Netflix’s competitors. For example, the “with ads” version of HBO Max averages about four minutes an hour, while Peacock tops out at about five minutes per hour.  It’s also worth noting that Netflix isn’t putting ads in children’s programming or in “new” Netflix Originals movies. Nope, not everything. Netflix licenses many of its movies and TV shows from third parties, including some Netflix Originals, and those agreements will need to be renegotiated before Netflix can insert ads into those videos for streaming.  According to Netflix chief operating officer Greg Peters, anywhere between 5 and 10 percent of programming on Netflix’s ad-free tiers will be unavailable for “with ads” users, although Peters says the streamer will “work to reduce that number over time.", "Additionally, some titles will not be available for Basic With Ads subscribers because of licensing restrictions preventing them from being shown with ads. Users on Netflix's cheapest plan will also lose the ability to download shows and movies to their devices for offline viewing. The main difference will come during the viewing experience.

To date, each installment of The Crown has spanned approximately a decade. The fifth season was initially expected to be the show’s final installment and take the royals from the early ’90s into the 2000s, however showrunner Peter Morgan later changed his mind, deciding instead to split the events of the decade into two seasons. “As we started to discuss the storylines for series five, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan said. With that in mind, Season 5 is likely to begin in the early ’90s and end somewhere in the middle of that decade. By Hannah Coates By Alexandra Macon By Hannah Jackson The first half of the ’90s was particularly tumultuous for the Queen, with plenty of incidents that are ripe for dramatization.

Filming will take place at the usual Elstree Studios, just north of London, and is expected to abide by strict COVID-19 protocols, even as lockdown measures in the United Kingdom begin to ease up.  With production beginning this summer, Season 5 likely won't arrive to Netflix until 2022, Deadline previously reported. The delay wasn't caused by the coronavirus pandemic, however. Apparently, the break was planned all along.  After Season 4 debuted last fall, fans will have to wait more than a year for the next installment. Of course, this isn't the first time The Crown has taken a long break; there was a two-year wait between Seasons 2 and 3 too.

And with Season 6 slated to bring the story into the early 2000s, per Variety, that means Season 5 could cover the late '90s; but that's yet to be confirmed.    The Crown was meant to last for six seasons from the start. After the show first debuted, Netflix's head of content, Ted Sarandos, said in 2016, \"The idea is to do this over six decades, in six seasons presumably, and make the whole show over eight to 10 years.\" Sarandos's plan seemed to be further solidified in October 2019, when show creator Peter Morgan signed a massive overall deal with Netflix. Sources had told Deadline that the agreement would include two more seasons of The Crown following Season 4. After all the back and forth, we're back to Plan A.  Just as the cast was updated after the first two seasons, the show is doing the same by the time it arrives to Season 5.

Yes. On October 20, Netflix released the first official trailer for The Crown Season 5—and it’s a scorcher. It opens with a shot of Windsor Castle in flames (a fire ravaged the royal residence during the Queen’s annus horribilis in 1992) and then shows Imelda Staunton as the monarch, examining its ashen remains. “In light of the events of the last 12 months, perhaps I have more to reflect on than most,” she muses in voiceover.

In the 22 midterm elections from 1934 -2018, the President's party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president’s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president’s party has gained seats in both houses only twice. The incumbent president’s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government. If the Democrats lose control of either House, the Administration can expect to be the target of numerous disruptive congressional inquiries. Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected.

Before Republicans take control of the chamber, Congress is already preparing for a lame duck session that is expected to stretch into the end of the year. Leaders hope to finalize a bipartisan budget deal to fund government agencies through the rest of the fiscal year and avoid a possible government shutdown.

If Democrats were able to keep the House and the Senate, they would likely restart negotiations on some of Biden’s agenda items that were never passed, including his new package of social and economic programs that stalled amid internal Democratic disagreements.

Compared to speech development, however, much less is known about how infants process songs or how songs affect their development. Lyrics and melody are two key components of songs, and much of the research on song processing has examined how the two components of the songs are processed. The current study focused on the roles of lyrics and melody in song perception, by examining developmental patterns and the ways in which lyrics and melody are processed in the infants' brains using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The results revealed that developmental changes occur in infants' processing of lyrics and melody in a similar timeline as perceptual reorganization, that is, from 4.5 and 12 months of age. We found that 4.5-month-olds showed a right hemispheric advantage in the processing of songs that underwent a change in either lyrics or melodies. Conversely, 12-month-olds showed significantly higher activation bilaterally when lyrics and melody changed at the same time. These results suggest that 4.5-month-olds processed songs in the same manner as music without lyrics. Moreover, 12-month-olds processed lyrics and melody in an interactive manner, a sign of a more mature processing method.", "A new mother discovers a lullaby in an ancient book and soon regards the song as a blessing, but her world transforms into a nightmare when the lullaby brings forth the ancient demon Lilith.A new mother discovers a lullaby in an ancient book and soon regards the song as a blessing, but her world transforms into a nightmare when the lullaby brings forth the ancient demon Lilith.A new mother discovers a lullaby in an ancient book and soon regards the song as a blessing, but her world transforms into a nightmare when the lullaby brings forth the ancient demon Lilith. © 1990-2023 by IMDb.com, Inc."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Several companion characters have returned to the series after leaving the Doctor's company, most notably in the Series Four finale \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" (2008), which features a record eight past, present and future companions: Donna is joined by a returning Rose, Martha, Jack, Sarah Jane, and Mickey, while past companion K9 and future companion Wilfred Mott make appearances.", "In the long-running BBC television science fiction programme Doctor Who and related works, the term \"companion\" refers to a character who travels or shares adventures with the Doctor. In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often furthers the story by asking questions (often to help the audience understand too) and getting into trouble; also by helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as their \"friends\" or \"assistants\"; the British press have also used the latter term.  In the earliest episodes of Doctor Who, the dramatic structure of the programme's cast was rather different from the hero-and-sidekick pattern that emerged later. Initially, the character of the Doctor was unclear, with uncertain motives and abilities.[1]  The protagonists were schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who provided the audience's point of view in stories set in Earth's history and on alien worlds. Ian in particular served the role of the action hero. The fourth character was the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, who (though initially presented as an \"unearthly child\") was intended[citation needed] as an identification figure for younger viewers.", "Russell T Davies, Doctor Who showrunner, said: \"It’s the great honour of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a star already. She’s brilliant, dynamic, clever and a wonderful actor. As a Coronation Street fan, I’ve seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that’s nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday.\" Sign up for the latest Who news, reviews, interviews and features By entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Doctor Who script editor Scott Handcock recently shared that secret auditions were held for the new companion in September, with Gatwa, the next Doctor, in attendance. Fans of the BBC sci-fi series were left surprised when last month's special, The Power of the Doctor, closed with Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor regenerating into a Fourteenth incarnation played by David Tennant, who'd previously portrayed the Tenth Doctor. Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for three special episodes, set to air in November 2023 to mark the show's 60th anniversary.", "Although the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series—including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

In the ninth minute Craig Goodwin gave Australia the lead when he finished at the back post high into the net after a low cross from the right by Mathew Leckie. Adrien Rabiot made it 1–1 when he headed to the net from a Théo Hernandez cross from the left. France took the lead five minutes later when Olivier Giroud side footed to the net after a low cross from Rabiot from the left.[7] In the 68th minute Kylian Mbappé scored with a header from six yards out to the left corner after a cross from Ousmane Dembélé on the right. Giroud got his second with another header after a Mbappé cross from the left to make it 4–1.[8] Giroud's second goal equalled Thierry Henry's all-time scoring record of 51 goals for France.[9] France's win marked the first time since 2006 that the defending champions won their opening game.

Kingsley Coman plays into Griezmann’s feet (white arrow) and he combines with Mbappe (blue then gold arrow) to get into the six-yard box…  … Griezmann’s shot hits goalkeeper Yann Sommer and loops to Benzema at the back post.  This was one of three France goals in quick succession and they have a habit of second-half goalscoring flurries. There were similar instances in the Nations League semi-final (three goals in the last 30 minutes) and final (two goals in 15 second-half minutes), as well as the World Cup 2018 quarter-final (three goals in 11 minutes). They do not start games exceptionally well and have not scored a competitive first-half goal since November 2021 — eight games ago against Kazakhstan.", "Whatever Deschamps says at half-time seems to be working, across all competitive games since the 2018 World Cup, France’s attacking output in the second half is significantly better than the first 45 minutes.

In April, Warner Bros. debuted a handful of character posters, which gave more insight into who everyone from the cast was playing. The studio also released the official poster for the film, which features Robbie and Gosling on the iconic Barbie logo.   The first teaser trailer for the Barbie movie dropped on Dec. 16, 2022. The 74-second clip opens with little girls playing with baby dolls in a rugged setting.   \"Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls,\" the narrator can be heard saying. \"But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls. Until ...\"   The camera then cuts to Robbie towering over the girls in a black-and-white striped bathing suit, black heels and white sunglasses. In awe of Barbie, the girls decide to smash their baby dolls.   Viewers then get a brief look at the playful and colorful world of Barbie.   On Dec. 17, 2022, Liu spoke to PEOPLE about the clip and his experience making the film.", "Aside from Barbie and Ken's getaway plan, we don't know too much about the plot. Though it's safe to assume the movie probably won't be a straightforward, fluffy film á la Barbie Life in The Dreamhouse. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Robbie confirmed as much. \"People immediately have an idea of, 'Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is,'\" she said, \"But our goal is to be like, 'Whatever you’re thinking, we’re going to give you something totally different—the thing you didn’t know you wanted.'\"  The rumors of the film harboring multiple Barbies have been confirmed by Sex Education and Death on The Nile alum, Mackey. Speaking to Empire, Mackey mentioned a sleepover amongst the Barbie cast that has fans talking. “Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies, which would involve playing games with Scott [Evans] and Ncuti [Gatwa],” she said.  She later added, \"Barbie is light and funny and silly and American and pink.\" Rest assured, it won't make you cry. \"It’s very unexpected in many ways,\" Mackey said. I think people are going to have an idea of the film, and I don’t think it’s going to be that. It’s going to be a surprise. And it’s a comedy, thank God. No crying in this film! Let me tell you that. No crying!", "Rumours about Lipa's involvement in the film started in May 2022, so we're very pleased they became a reality (as real as Barbie gets anyway...).

Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'

For now, the film’s release date is July 21, 2023. The film has landed another heavy hitter for its male lead. Blue Valentine actor Ryan Gosling is in final negotiations to play Barbie’s beau Ken, per Deadline. The Academy Award nominee has apparently been the studio’s only choice from the beginning, and he has now signed on after finding an opening in his schedule. With Gosling signing on, it looks like the long-awaited project can start filming in early 2022. Several cast announcements have been rolling out in the past few weeks, with major stars joining Robbie and Gosling in the upcoming film. One surprising casting, Sex Education star Emma Mackey, has drawn attention since she and Robbie look so similar.

When I found out I got the part I called her singing the Aqua 'Barbie' song.\" As for reuniting with Mackey, Gatwa felt it to be a blessing. \"We had just had such an intense five years together where we all became so close. We love each other so much and it's incredibly exciting seeing everyone go off and do their own things, but to be able to come back together? That's a magical experience.\" Ana Cruz Kayne has an impressive list of credits to her name, including the inventive sci-fi film Another Earth (2011), the CBS crime drama series Bull, Louis C.K.'s sitcom Louie, the Tom Selleck drama Blue Bloods, and the upcoming Netflix series Painkiller.

But eight goals in 19 games this campaign sees him getting hot at just the right moment, and that form is what earned him the call-up.

Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.  The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.  Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.[75]  Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986.", "1990: Cameroon, 2002: Senegal, 2010: Ghana Three African teams have gone out in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and all did so in painful fashion.

They stunned defending champions Argentina in the tournament’s opening game at the San Siro and that momentum saw them go on and top a group also containing Romania and the Soviet Union.

There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shootout to determine who progressed to the next round.[82]  In this round, each group winner (A-H) was paired against the runner-up from another group.

There has been an unmistakable glass ceiling over Africa at football World Cups. In reaching the quarter-finals in the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon set a benchmark that has not been bettered yet. Senegal and Ghana also reached the last-eight, in 2002 and 2010 respectively, but the continent’s tale of the tape on the global stage has been one of relative underachievement. Powered by Roger Milla’s swivelling hips and a fearless athleticism, Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions were the shining light of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Wins over holders Argentina, Romania and Colombia set the bar high and, for the first time, an African side claimed three wins at a World Cup. That performance was widely expected to herald a new age of achievement. It also seemed to justify Pele’s assertion that an African team would win the World Cup by 2000. However, that prediction would ultimately fall short. But in 2002, Senegal staked claims for the big prize. Amid a hail of falling seeds early on, the team set out its stall by beating reigning champions France and becoming the first African team to go through a World Cup group stage undefeated.

Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck. They both know how thankless the job is, but they also still are true believers in college athletics. A popular internal option would be Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's senior vice president of basketball who is the association's most respected employee. The NCAA could also continue to go the route of college presidents, which has been the prior model the past two full-time presidents -- Myles Brand and Emmert.

Alegre kept things vague, saying Otherside will “bring communities together” to “interact with themselves” and “bring new and innovative Web3-based experiences starting with gaming.”  The concept of virtual worlds, for entertainment  and for business uses, has captivated the tech industry but it’s not yet clear whether consumers will buy into the concept. Facebook-parent company Meta is building its own virtual world dubbed Horizon World. Speaking at Fortune Brainstorm Tech on Tuesday, Meta VP Vishal Shah said consumers will ease into digital worlds gradually:  “I don’t think it’s like a light switch, where one day you’ll suddenly feel like you’re in the metaverse, whereas the day before you weren’t,” Shah said.” I think it will be an iterative process over the course of many years.” Alegre specified that Yuga Labs makes money via issuing new events, secondary trading of its NFTs, and partnerships with brands like Gucci. Yuga Labs is likely still sitting on a heap of capital from its whopping $450 million seed round it raised in March 2022, led by Andreessen Horowitz.

And the only thing that people got out of it was just knowing their real names,” added Muniz. The danger, Muniz said, revolved primarily around potentially attracting “nefarious characters” in and around the crypto industry.  “In the crypto community, there are these things called crypto whales. It’s people who have made a lot of money in crypto. And it’s attracted some nefarious characters and it has put people in severe jeopardy,” added Muniz during her D3 interview.  She also said there is a “misconception” that these founders are crypto whales.  Earlier this month, Buzzfeed published an investigation revealing Wylie Aranow and Greg Solano as two of the four Bored Ape founders.  The investigation did not reveal anything negative about the two individuals, earning Buzzfeed a trouncing on Twitter from the crypto community.  “Doxxing people for clicks and ad revenue.", "What Yuga Labs wants to build after raising $450M", "Typical Buzzfeed trash.

Avatar: The Way of Water, which has been years in production, received two Golden Globes nominations earlier this week, for best drama film and best director. Reviews have generally been positive, with viewers giving it a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while critics on the site give it a 78%. It also has a 69/100 review from critics and a 71/100 general review on Metacritic, and posted a score of 8.2/10 on IMDb. Earlier this week, the Hollywood Reporter called the sequel “monumental,” and said it “justifies its three-hours-plus of screen time and its mammoth financial investment,” although Variety was less favorable in its review, criticizing the movie for having “almost zero dimensionality to the characters,” while The Guardian dubbed it a “trillion-dollar screensaver.” $400 million.

The first Avatar movie grossed over $2.", "“Expectations aside, this is outstanding,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “The movie is set up for a very strong run through the holidays.”  \tAs the sequel to the highest-grossing movie in history, Hollywood has some pretty high expectations for “The Way of Water,” which is Cameron’s first film to clear $100 million in a single weekend. The first “Avatar” opened in 2009 with $77 million domestically: a decent start but hardly one for the record books. But the film enjoyed unparalleled staying power, holding the No. 1 spot for seven weeks in a row and continuing to draw audiences for months. Thanks to pricey 3D tickets and repeat viewings, ticket sales eventually climbed to $760 million in North America and $2.92 billion globally.  \t“The Way of Water” will struggle to reach that benchmark, given the restrictions facing the COVID-battered box office. It won’t be playing in Russia, where the original film grossed $116 million. Though it is screening in China, the country’s box office has been struggling to rebound. Inaugural ticket sales in the country were below expectations at $57.1 million. In pandemic times, only three movies have crossed $1 billion worldwide and none have managed to hit $2 billion (though “Spider-Man: No Way Home” came close with $1.9 billion).", "The true measure of box office success for James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water was always going to come down to how well the film would hold as it entered its second and third weekends in the market. After opening with the #37 highest-earning debut frame of all-time in the domestic market, the sequel held on with the #30 sophomore frame, and has just finished the New Year’s corridor with the fourth-highest tally for a film in its third weekend.  Last weekend, 20th Century Studios’ sci-fi sequel Avatar: The Way of Water dropped -53% in its sophomore frame to $63.3M. That more than doubled the combined debuts of its three new Christmas weekend competitors, all of which fell below expectations. Now in its third frame, the film increases <1% to $63.4M, easily holding onto third place.

However, its daunting 192-minute runtime could intimidate people from wanting to watch the movie again and again.  \tTurnout for “Avatar 2” was especially strong on Imax and 3D screens, with 62% of ticket sales coming from premium formats. Globally, the film made $48.8 million from Imax alone, registering as the company’s second-biggest weekend ever and highest December opening in history.  \t“As excited as we are about these early results, we anticipate a long and successful run for ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ as more people around the world book their ticket to Pandora for the epic storytelling and unmissable visual splendor of what James Cameron and his team have created,” says Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax.  \tGiven the hype around Cameron’s grand return to Pandora, rival studios opted to lay low so holdover titles rounded out the rest of box office charts.

Alberto Mielgo, director of The Windshield Wiper, later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar: \"Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine. Animation for adults is a fact. It's happening. Let's call it cinema. I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.\"[29] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision to not broadcast the award.[30]  Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG-13 or more, with a few of them —The Triplets of Belleville, Persepolis, Chico and Rita, The Wind Rises, Anomalisa, My Life as a Courgette, The Breadwinner, Loving Vincent, Isle of Dogs, I Lost My Body and Flee— having been nominated in this category, though none have won.[31][32]", "As there's been a rise in popularity of Korean film and TV shows – especially since especially since the success of Netflix's \"Squid Games\" – more and more U.S.-based content is being reimagined for Korean dramas and actors. The survey showed about 50% of respondents wanted to see Steven Spielberg direct a K-drama, and actors like Colin Farrell and Cate Blanchett star in such films. More than 50% of the respondents also said if they had it their way, they'd see the latest \"Avatar\" installment remade into a Korean film. Here's the breakdown of the responses for the social media poll: –Lillian Rizzo Heading into Sunday's ceremony, Steven Spielberg had already become the first director to be nominated across six decades, earning nods for \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" in the '70s, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" in the '80s, \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" in the '90s, \"Munich\" in the '00s, \"Lincoln\" in the '10s and \"West Side Story\" in 2021 He is nominated this year for \"The Fablemans,\" a film based on his own childhood and introduction to filmmaking in post-war America.", "The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is given each year for animated films. An animated feature is defined by the Academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.[1][2][3]  The entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award's inception. If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category, the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films, otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist.[4]  For much of the Academy Awards' history, AMPAS was resistant to the idea of a regular award for animated features, considering there were simply too few produced to justify such consideration.[5] Instead, the Academy occasionally bestowed special Oscars for exceptional productions, usually for Walt Disney Pictures, such as for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1938,[6] and the Special Achievement Academy Award for the live action/animated hybrid Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1989[7] and Toy Story in 1996."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

It may be a ‘death wish.’ Chew says he was first introduced to DST Global, a venture capital firm that bet on major tech firms including Facebook and Twitter, while he was working at Goldman Sachs. After completing Harvard Business School, he worked with DST Global as a partner, where he helped to coordinate one of the earliest investments in ByteDance by building relationships with its two young founding engineers, Liang Rubo and Zhang Yiming. He spent five years working with Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi, where he helped lead an initial public offering, before being appointed CEO of TikTok and chief financial officer of its parent company, ByteDance.", "Chew had a two-year internship with Facebook. After earning his MBA, he became a partner at venture capital firm DST Global, where he worked for five years and helped facilitate investment in the company that became ByteDance. He then worked for five years at Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone company, before being appointed TikTok CEO in 2021, replacing Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive. Chew reports to ByteDance CEO Liang Rubo. The U.S. public knows relatively little about Chew compared with Silicon Valley social media giants such as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, said Brooke Erin Duffy, who studies social media platforms as an associate professor of communications at Cornell University.  “Chew has been in the background on public discourse until now, so he doesn’t have the same reputation we would associate with the Silicon Valley set, especially Zuckerberg,” Duffy said. Most Americans likely first heard of Chew when he released a video this week speaking directly to TikTok’s U.S. users, she said, “so he doesn’t have the same reputation as someone we know, and (we) don’t have sense of who he is.” But Chew is well-respected within the U.S. and China tech communities, and was considered a good fit for TikTok because of his background in investment banking and his time at Facebook and DST Global, said Dan Ives, managing director of New York-based Wedbush Securities.", "He has also, with help from a high-level preparatory team, worked to steel himself for congressional members’ responses, which probably will include several tough questions designed to elicit viral sound bites. In meetings with lawmakers, Chew has worked to provide technical details of Project Texas, a restructuring plan that TikTok says would neutralize the risk of data theft or misuse by the Chinese government, and talked at length about the company’s investments in children’s safety efforts and content moderation, according to people who have attended. He has called on lawmakers to push for industry-wide regulations that would hold TikTok and its American rivals to the same set of rules. He has also urged them to think past the counter-lobbying of TikTok’s competitors, most notably Facebook parent company Meta, which The Post first reported last year had funded a nationwide media and lobbying campaign designed to portray its rival as a generational threat. Chew has also used his own platform in his lobbying efforts. In a recently uploaded video, Chew, dressed casually in jeans and a hoodie, emphasized that 5 million U.S. businesses used that app and that the company had 7,000 employees in the United States. “Some politicians have started talking about banning TikTok. Now this could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you,” he said, urging users to post comments with “what you want your elected representatives to know about what you love about TikTok.", "Representative Neal Dunn (R-FL) asks TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew if ByteDance has ever spied on American citizens, Chew… TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew makes four commitments in his opening statement to Congress, pledging to ensure safety for… Ashley Gold previewed TikTok CEO Shou Chew testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the company’s… The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology convened a hearing with a panel of communications… Experts testified at a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection hearing on internet safety and… Telecommunications industry officials testified on efforts to secure 5G wireless networks at a virtual House Energy and…"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

There was a moment when “Jerry’s” talking about how the grocery story isn’t a great place to hear celebrity gossip. He said something like how it’s difficult to get juicy details while you’re picking up a carton of eggs. There’s a brief beat of silence before the laugh track kicks in, and I guffawed wondering if the AI put that laugh track there because it knows egg prices are absurd right now. There’s another bit where “Elaine” talks about how the city’s passing an ordinance against jaywalking and how she’ll never get anywhere in the city anymore. I don’t understand why, but I laughed along with the laugh track. AI programs are doing a lot these days, up to and including my very job. I’ve never seen an episode of Seinfeld, so I can’t vouch for whether or not an AI can faithfully reproduce what people tell me is one of the all-time great television shows. But the only thing that seems missing is that iconic funky baseline, which I imagine is hard to play if you have 37 fingers.", "The fourth season ends with 'The Pilot', an episode focusing on the casting, taping, and screening of the show-within-the-show, Jerry. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.[125] William Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing. Some entries include \"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\", \"George's Failed Quest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\", \"Elaine's Moral Character\", \"Kramer the 'Seducer'\", \"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\", \"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\", \"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\", and \"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\".[126]  Seinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s.", "Seinfeld’s protagonists wouldn’t be caught dead saying the things these people say. In one comedy club scene, for instance, Larry asks the audience: “Have you ever had one of those days where no matter how hard you try, nothing goes your way? Yeah, we’ve all been there.” Later, Fred says he’s planning to write a book about “how I managed to make it through the toughest times”. Larry offers a classic Seinfeld riposte: “You’ve certainly gone through a lot. It sounds like a great story. I’d certainly be interested in reading it when you’re finished.” Who’d have thought autogenerated characters would have too much empathy? The whole thing feels like how a 1980s sci-fi writer might imagine a robot-created TV show from the future. Which, of course, is exactly what it is. It feels disturbingly like the kind of content our corporate overlords might be feeding us in 20 years to melt our brains and ensure quiet compliance. “Technology is really convenient in a lot of ways, but it can also be dangerous,” says Fred in one of the show’s disturbingly self-aware lines. “I guess it’s up to us to decide when it’s worth taking the risk.” Credit to its creators for a remarkable achievement – a delightfully bizarre experiment that sheds a little more light on the question.", "nb 1] It was largely written by David and Seinfeld, with script writers who included Larry Charles, Peter Mehlman, Gregg Kavet, Carol Leifer, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer, Steve Koren, Jennifer Crittenden, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Dan O'Keefe, Charlie Rubin, Marjorie Gross, Alec Berg, Elaine Pope and Spike Feresten. A favorite among critics, the series led the Nielsen ratings in Seasons 6 and 9 and finished among the top two (with NBC's ER) every year from 1994 to 1998. Only two other shows–I Love Lucy and The Andy Griffith Show–have finished their runs at the top of the ratings.[3]  Seinfeld is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms of all time. It has been ranked among television's best shows in publications such as Entertainment Weekly,[4] Rolling Stone[5] and TV Guide.[6][7] Its most renowned episodes include \"The Chinese Restaurant\", \"The Soup Nazi\", \"The Parking Garage\",[8] \"The Marine Biologist\" and \"The Contest\".[9] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America voted it the No. 2 Best-Written TV Series of All Time (second to The Sopranos).[10] E!", "The result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes. An eerie, out-of-place laugh track imbues the AI’s clumsy conversations with a slightly sinister undertone. The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they’re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld’s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: “As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it. And so that became one of our grounding pillars.” After watching the stream, creatives can likely rest easy that AI isn’t coming for their jobs, yet.

The program is expected to cost $345 million annually by its fourth year, once it is fully phased in, according to a new analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency. Over the course of the first four years, the state would spend about $879 million as the program phases in.

The bill says the Iowa Department of Education may contract with an outside company to administer the ESA program, but it is unknown how much that will cost. Rep. Wills said he is comfortable increasing spending for the ESA program because it has been a legislative priority of Republicans who expanded their majorities in the fall elections. “The bottom line is, this is a priority of the Republican caucus,” Wills said on IPR’s River to River. “This is a priority for the governor, this is a priority for the Senate and the House. We want to put parents back in the driver's seat and we're willing to pay for that.” The fiscal study of the school choice bill estimates that around 12% of the students who receive ESAs would come from public schools.

Democrats have criticized Republicans over the cost of the plan, following multiple years when the public school funding increase approved by GOP lawmakers fell short of what advocates said was necessary to keep up with increasing costs. “Until we are willing to provide adequate funding for the vast majority of our public school students, we should not be creating a private, exclusive school entitlement program with unknown costs and unlimited funding — a blank check,” said Sen.

{"id": 249, "query": "who founded midjourney?", "ans": ["David Holz"], "label": [-1], "prediction": "I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.", "docs": ["The hardest part of [a commercial art project] is often at the beginning, when the stakeholder doesn’t know what they want and has to see some ideas to react to. Midjourney can help people converge on the idea they want much more quickly, because iterating on those concepts is very laborious. Another advantage for artists is it gives people confidence in areas they’re not confident in. Most if not all artists feel like there’s some part of art they can’t do well. It might be colors, composition, backgrounds. We have a famous character designer using our product and people ask him why would you use an AI since you’re so good already. And he said, “well, I’m only good at the character part. This is helping me build out the rest of the world.” About how many people are using the product? Millions are using it. Our Discord is over two million. It’s the biggest active Discord server by far now. Does Midjourney’s license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by the platform? Yes. But if you’re working for a company bigger than a million dollars in annual revenue, we ask that you buy a corporate license. How was the dataset built? It’s just a big scrape of the Internet. We use the open data sets that are published and train across those. And I’d say that’s something that 100% of people do. We weren’t picky.", "He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "So far though, Holz said there hadn't been any complaints, what's more, some famous artists who use the platform say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.” But if the problem does arise, Holz said the team is open to it, although they don’t have a process for that yet. Speaking of art style, Midjourney has some distinguishing features no other tool like this has. It's \"artistic\" in a way that the generated images look like paintings and never like photos. \"We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more realistic.\" Midjourney's style is \"whimsical and abstract and weird.\" Holz shared that it has favorite colors (it uses a lot of blues and oranges) and faces. The developers don’t know why it happens, \"but there’s a particular woman’s face it likes to draw\" – people call it “Miss Journey.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that’s been surprising to me.", "\"They're using it as an emotional and intellectual reflective tool,\" he said. \"And that's really cool.\" Holz dislikes the idea of using Midjourney to create fake photographs. \"Using it editorially to create fake photos is extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"No one should do that.\" But he's more open to Midjourney as a source of commercial illustration, noting that The Economist ran a Midjourney graphic on its cover in June. \"We only recently allowed people to use it commercially,\" said Holz. \"For a long time, it was non-commercial only. And so one of the things we're doing is we're just watching it, what people are doing, and we might decide that we're not comfortable with some of that and then we're going to put in a rule saying you can no longer use it just for those things.\" Holz said he sees AI tools like Midjourney making artists better at what they do rather than making everyone a professional artist. \"An artist using these tools is always better than a regular person using these tools. At some point, might there be pressure to use these tools because you can make things that are so great? I think yes. But right now, I don't think it's quite there yet. But it will get shockingly better over the next two years."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

And we are able to have our AI act upon billions of interactions from pinners that make these product associations, which is very different than what you'd find on any other social media platform or really any other shopping platform.\" These efforts around AI, coupled with fresh cost cuts, are expected to drive margin expansion this year for Pinterest in the face of an ad sales market that Ready says is still \"choppy.\" Pinterest sees first-quarter sales growing by a low-single-digit percentage year over year. Expenses are forecast to drop by low double digits.

Pinterest’s ad tech partnerships have already started benefiting advertisers, which positions the company for increased revenues in the future, UBS analysts said in the report. Ready’s revamped advertising strategy includes partnering with companies that can improve Pinterest’s targeting and measurement capabilities. It is already working with LiveRamp, a California-based software company, to develop clean rooms, or digital spaces where advertisers and Pinterest can share their data. The LiveRamp partnership alone has made Pinterest’s ads more effective, and it has opened the door for collaborations with other businesses, UBS analysts said. A future partnership with Google, Ready’s former employer, could be a massive boost for the platform, they said. Since Ready joined Pinterest, the company rolled out a tool called whole page optimization, which increased the number of ads a user sees when they are shopping on the app. With this launch, Pinterest earns revenue from showing more ads, and users see more relevant ads.", "Ready takes over the company at an interesting time, as the company has pushed hard to lead in creating a better kind of social network while also dealing with internal accusations about a problematic and discriminatory work culture.

Even Meta's reversing its position on remote work in some ways and encouraging people to come back to the office. PFEIFFER: Interesting. You know, Zuckerberg has said things like the layoffs were caused by things like rising interest rates, geopolitical tension, new regulations. Do you, Sam, based on your reporting, buy that? Do you believe that - those reasons? SCHECHNER: I think those confluence of factors certainly are playing a role. And I think - you mentioned regulations.

There's changes that they've had to make because of, you know, privacy moves by Apple to cut off some of the data that they've been using that have also cut into their revenue. So I think all of those things together are factors.", "Meta is far from the only Big Tech company to undergo layoffs amid higher inflation, recession fears and a whiplash in pandemic-induced demand. In the first months of this year, Amazon                              (AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft                              (MSFT) have all confirmed major job cuts impacting tens of thousands of tech workers.     Silicon Valley layoffs go from bad to worse         Shares of Meta rose more than 4% in early trading Tuesday following the announcement.            When the first round of job cuts was announced in November, Zuckerberg blamed himself at the time for the company’s over-hiring earlier in the pandemic. Meta  nearly doubled its headcount between March 2020 and September of last year, as the Covid-19 crisis led to a surge in demand for digital services.             But the situation changed radically for the social media giant and other tech companies as pandemic restrictions eased and people returned to their offline lives. Meta’s core business was also hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple                              (AAPL) and advertisers tightening budgets amid recession fears.             In his post on Tuesday announcing the latest cost-cutting efforts at Meta, Zuckerberg called the last year “a humbling wake-up call.”            “The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably,” he wrote.", "“We are a technology company, and our ultimate output is what we build for people,” Zuckerberg said. As part of the restructuring, the company will also increase the number of direct reports each manager has. Zuckerberg told analysts in February that the Meta plans “on cutting projects that aren’t performing or may no longer be crucial” while simultaneously “removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.” “A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster,” Zuckerberg’s message said. Still, Meta continues to spend billions of dollars developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies required to build the digital universe coined the metaverse. The company’s Reality Labs division that’s tasked with creating the metaverse lost about $13.7 billion in 2022 on $2.16 billion of revenue. Amazon announced a new round of layoffs in January, affecting 18,000 employees across multiple divisions. Twilio, Dell, Zoom and eBay also recently disclosed significant cuts to their workforce. In January, Google revealed plans to lay off more than 12,000 workers, Microsoft announced plans to cut 10,000 employees and Salesforce said it planned to cut 7,000 jobs. Jonathan Vanian is a technology reporter for CNBC.com Rohan Goswami is an associate reporter on CNBC’s technology team.", "Meta joins other tech companies, such as Snap, that have laid off employees as economic conditions have grown more challenging. While many of these companies boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, some of the largest ones have reported financial results in recent weeks that showed they are feeling the fallout of global economic jitters. Last week, Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, laid off roughly half the company’s 7,500 employees, saying the social media service was losing $4 million a day. “These cycles of boom and bust are incredibly destructive within organizations because people employed there feel like they don’t know where they stand,” said Sandra J. Sucher, a management professor at Harvard. By rapidly hiring across all departments during the pandemic, Mr. Zuckerberg had set up his company to need reductions in staff, she said. Mr. Zuckerberg has been telegraphing that Meta will have to clamp down on costs, starting with cutting back on many of the lavish perks that employees once enjoyed. In March, he announced that the company was trimming or eliminating free services like laundry and dry cleaning. He also scaled back free dinner offerings, making it harder for employees to take home dinner for themselves and their families. In July, Mr. Zuckerberg warned employees that the company was experiencing “one of the worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and in September he announced a hiring freeze.

He’s intelligent. And he’s got good skills. I like where he’s at right now.

Google’s Pixel hardware took center stage during the keynote, as the company launched three new products: the Pixel Fold, the Pixel Tablet, and the budget-friendly Pixel 7A.

Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology’s ability to foster deeper human connection. “It’s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,” he said. “It’s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I’m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.” None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. “It’s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,” he said. “Remember when people didn’t want to share that they met on a dating app? That’s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves.", "What I will call a success is when people are proud to use Keys to communicate because it means you’re working on yourself to be a better communicator.” Some users aren’t just using AI for messaging; they’re also leveraging AI tools to optimize themselves in every feature of a dating app. Dax Flame, 31, a content creator in Los Angeles, began an experiment this year to let AI run every aspect of his life while he documented the journey on YouTube. “I used ChatGPT to help me with a bio on Tinder and message the first matches I got,” he said. “I asked for the ideal bio. Some of the aspects didn’t fit me, but it felt nice and conversational. Eventually, I asked for a more personalized version, and that one was a little bit better. I cut out the guitar strummer part because I don’t play guitar.” Your Move also recently rolled out a feature that helps generate the perfect dating app profile. Slate writer Heather Tal Murphy also turned to ChatGPT to land dates for a friend on the dating apps Tinder and Bumble. “ChatGPT encouraged an odd strain of forwardness that was helpful in getting the dates set up quickly,” Tal Murphy wrote. are you not impressed? because I am https://t.co/uWLchKL432 pic.twitter.com/7fHtYWEEDq Suman Kanuganti, the founder of Personal.", "“Some of the responses were so absurd that they ended up being funny, but not in the way the app likely intended.” He said he doesn’t plan on using the app again. “I anticipate that I’ll continue these conversations manually,” Lloyd said.", "Careers"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}
{"id": 278, "query": "Who is the new sporting director of U.S. Soccer?", "ans": ["Matt Crocker"], "label": [-1], "prediction": "I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents. The document explains the recent departures of Earnie Stewart and Brian McBride but does not mention who has been appointed as the new sporting director.", "docs": ["The Dutch-born Stewart was rare in that he was both a decorated former USMNT player and an experienced executive both in MLS in the Netherlands before being recruited by U.S. Soccer in 2018. Peter Vermes, the longtime coach and general manager of Sporting Kansas City, has a similar — though not as varied — résumé as Stewart’s. Vermes was one of the first American-born players to carve out a career in Europe, and he captained the 1990 World Cup team. He knows the U.S. player pool inside out and also has experience in the international game. But would the longest-tenured coach in MLS be willing to leave the sideline?   Another possibility is John Thorrington, the GM of MLS Cup champ LAFC. Viewed as a rising C-suite star, Thorrington won four U.S. caps and was employed by clubs in England, Canada, Germany and the U.S. during his playing career. Other highly regarded domestic candidates like Tim Bezbatchenko and Garth Lagerwey have no international experience. (In any case, Lagerwey just took over Atlanta United after a wildly successful spell leading the Seattle Sounders.) Meantime, few foreign execs have intricate knowledge of U.S. Soccer and its teams. One intriguing name who also happens to be available is Ivan Gazidis.", "\"We were not able to focus — in the way we would all think we want to and should — on growing youth and adult participation; on growing the number of referees in this country; on growing the number of coaches,\" Batson said. Those discussions with Stewart led to further conversations with other U.S. Soccer staffers and stakeholders around the country. And in their work with Sportsology, the consulting firm brought in to lead the sporting director search, \"we got validation through the review as to how other federations [around the world] are organized, as well as feedback from our team around what's working well, and where are some challenges,\" Batson said. \"So,\" he said, \"put all those things together, and that's what's led us to do this.\" He and Cone acknowledged that there will be overlap between the sporting director position and the new position — in the talent identification realm, for example. And of course, for now, both are extremely conceptual; both could continue to evolve. But the new delineation, Batson explained, is that the sporting director will be \"looking at player pools of thousands or low tens of thousands, [and] coaching pools of hundreds\" — the very top of the pyramid. \"As an organization, we also need to be thinking strategically around player pools of millions, coaching pools of hundreds of thousands, referee pools of hundreds of thousands\" — and that's what the person who fills the new position will do.", "57  Sporting director Earnie Stewart is leaving U.S. Soccer and will return to the Netherlands to join Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven, the federation announced Thursday. Additionally, U.S. men’s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program. That’s a daunting position, but it also presents a huge opportunity for the federation ahead of the 2026 World Cup that the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico. Advertisement “I know this moment feels a bit uncertain,” USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone said on Thursday, “but what it actually is is a clean canvas.” U.S. Soccer CEO J.T.", "A former deputy MLS commissioner, Gazidis was AC Milan’s CEO until last month and spent a decade running current Premier League leader Arsenal before that.  How long until the USMNT has a full-time coach?  U.S. Soccer was hoping to have either Berhalter or his successor in place by early March at the latest. The USMNT has CONCACAF Nations League games against Grenada and El Salvador that month, with the Nations League finals and CONCACAF Gold Cup scheduled for this summer.  Now it seems likely that the men won’t have a coach until the end of the summer at the soonest, with interim manager Anthony Hudson staying on until at least then.   That’s hardly ideal. U.S. Soccer was heavily criticized for not signing Berhalter until late 2018; interim boss Dave Sarachan ran the squad for more than a year after the Americans failed to qualify for that World Cup. But Berhalter still had almost four entire years to build toward Qatar.   Now the Americans are almost guaranteed not to have a full-time leader less than three years before the 2026 World Cup that they’re co-hosting with Canada and Mexico kicks off.   In what ways does this impact the U.S. women?   It shouldn’t.", "Soccer calls its extended national teams (beach soccer, deaf soccer and more). It will also create a job description that better aligns with the skill sets of many qualified sporting directors throughout global soccer. Batson, speaking from the federation's annual general meeting in San Diego, told a small group of reporters that, in interviews with prospective sporting directors, candidates have given \"a lot of very positive feedback ... around the narrowing of focus.\" \"Folks have been pretty direct around appreciating that evolution,\" Batson said. What U.S. Soccer is looking for in its next sporting director, he said, is a \"pro at identifying, attracting, retaining and making successful elite-level sporting talent, and someone who can own our technical vision.\" And while that description is vague, and seems less influential than sporting director roles at clubs — where executives can sign and sell players, and actually shape the team on the field immediately — it will be more refined that it was previously. Batson said discussions about the \"evolution\" of the role began in Qatar, between him and Stewart. He realized, in those conversations and others, that \"to run our national team programs is more than a full-time job.\" This left other areas under Stewart's purview lacking the attention they deserved and required."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Robbie is such an important collaborator for me.    How did you collaborate with DP Ashley Connor to bring the look together? I’d never worked with her before, but I was just a huge fan of her work. She brought such thoughtfulness.

The mixing of the cultures and the different layers is just so exciting to see. The final act is a big Bollywood-inspired set piece at the wedding. It's really over the top and showcases the beauty of South Asian culture. [Then we also show the characters] at school, dressed in school uniforms, which are sort of British.  I'm also mixing all the genres I love; referencing all the movies I love. I would describe Polite Society as an action-comedy about sisterhood. The film is filled with action scenes; heights; crazy over-the-top violence, fun, and comedy. It was a chance for me to mix all the films I grew up on—the Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies.  Polite Society official trailer  For me, the action in the film really represents what it feels like to be a teenage girl—how it can feel so painful and violent when you're having fights at school, when you're fighting with your sister.

In a statement on Thursday, TCW said the fund, previously known as the Pimco Mortgage-Backed Securities Fund, will become the TCW Core Plus Bond Fund.

Over the past three years, the MetWest Total Return Bond Fund outperformed 95 percent of its peers, and the TCW Total Return Bond Fund outperformed 98 percent of its peers.

The Pixel Fold is far more accommodating to use folded than the Galaxy Z Fold, thanks to this wider display. In terms of thickness, the Pixel Fold measures just over 12mm deep without the camera bump when folded compared to the 14.2mm measurement of the Galaxy Z Fold 4. The inner display of the Pixel Fold measures 7.6 inches and is protected by ultra-thin glass (UTG), just like the Galaxy foldables. You get a 120Hz refresh rate both inside and outside. The 180-degree Fluid Friction hinge that takes the phone from its folded to unfolded state and opens at any angle is made of stainless steel. Google calls it the “most durable hinge of any foldable phone.” This claim is based on the company’s own durability testing, which included 200,000 folds and tumble drop tests of one meter. Despite the testing, Google clarifies that the Pixel Fold is not drop-proof. Like the current crop of foldables, the Pixel Fold is not exempt from the display crease curse. During our hands-on time with the phone, we did note a noticeable crease down the middle of the main display. It’s actually more pronounced than its competition from Samsung and especially OPPO. The good news is that the Pixel Fold is one of the few foldable phones on the market with an official IP rating.", "But the cover screen fares better on that front, and the Pixel Fold is at least built to last – Google claims it has the most durable hinge on a foldable, and the phone also has an IPX8 rating for water resistance. The back is clad in Gorilla Glass Victus, which should keep it safe from scratches, and the frame is polished aluminum.  The Google Pixel Fold has a 7.6-inch 1840 x 2208 OLED foldable display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 5.8-inch 1080 x 2092 OLED cover display with a 120Hz refresh rate. Those specs are broadly in line with the screen specs of rival devices. The Z Fold 4, for example, has the same size foldable screen but a slightly bigger 6.2-inch cover display. However, the Pixel Fold has a wider profile, which should mean the cover screen feels less narrow than on Samsung’s rival. Google has also worked to minimize the crease in the foldable screen as much as possible.  There’s a triple-lens rear camera on the Pixel Fold, just like on the Pixel 7 Pro, though it doesn’t use the same sensors. Here you get a 48MP f/1.7 primary camera, a 10.8MP f/2.2 ultra-wide, and a 10.8MP f/3.05 telephoto with 5x optical zoom.", "The spec sheet is impressive, the camera hardware seems like it could deliver some incredible results,” he writes. But, understanding that this is a first-generation product and when factoring in the relatively high price of the phone, his excitement was tempered somewhat. Our readers are largely on the fence. While a sliver over 50% of polled readers believe that the Pixel Fold is “hot,” only 24% of readers in a secondary poll admitted to pre-ordering the device already, with 23% not completely convinced just yet. A fairly sizeable 38% of readers don’t plan to buy the device. As Google’s first foldable, the Pixel Fold aims to provide a different experience to the Pixel 7 series. For starters, the company has optimized over 50 Google apps for the larger screen. Some of these apps will be Pixel-first and won’t be available on foldables from other brands. Google has also worked with some major apps like Spotify, Disney Plus, TikTok, eBay, Canva, and more to optimize them for the inner folding display. Streaming apps like Netflix, YouTube, and even Peloton support the Pixel Fold’s Tabletop mode (pictured above) for hands-free viewing. Besides app optimizations, which Google says is a continuous effort, the Pixel Fold also has some cool multitasking tricks up its sleeve.

But will it -- and the rest of Google's new gadgets -- be worth the wait?", "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — For many watching Google's I/O developer conference this week, the big draw is a full breakdown of the company's broader AI plans. But the company hasn’t just been working on software. During the conference’s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets — including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display — as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren’t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It’s not clear what role — if any — Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company’s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here’s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.", "6-inch screen is bright and easy on the eyes — it’s more than nice enough to take in your daily allotment of YouTube videos and e-books, not to mention running two apps side by side. The big bezels around the sides of the screen don’t look great, but they’re pretty comfortable places for your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold — like the much cheaper 7a — uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company’s Pixel 7 phones, released last October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this chip for — from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured by the Fold’s three rear cameras — may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many. Sure, it’s not alone there — Samsung’s premium Galaxy Z Fold 4 costs the same — but even luxe traditional smartphones cost hundreds less. And because the Fold physically bends in half, there’s a great chance of some kind of physical failure over time.

The uptick in this metric implies growth in the supply of candidates looking for work, which is good news for the economy and for the staffing industry. The prime age labor force participation rate (ages 25 through 54, those in the prime of their working years, being largely done with their education and too young to retire) recovered to its pre-pandemic peak of 83.1% in February and remained unchanged in March. Participation among people ages 55 and older continues to decline; the increasing participation rate represents people under 25 finding or looking for work. These trends suggest that labor scarcity will remain a challenge, particularly in the supply of experienced candidates, and scarcity will continue to support demand for staffing and workforce solutions even as economic growth slows. The March decline in Temporary help employment was the first decline since December. Overall, for 2023, employment in Temporary help services remains up by 9,300. Though nonetheless below the record-high levels seen in 2022, this remains consistent with our expectation for a plateauing of the industry in 2023.

Downward revisions to previous two months altered the spring employment picture meaningfully, subtracting a total of 149,000 jobs. That brings the three-month average to 222,000 jobs, a clear slowdown from the 400,000 added on average in 2022. Since early 2021, the labor market has been uncommonly tight as employers struggled to reverse a sudden mass layoff and navigate huge shifts in the demand for goods and services. The unemployment rate reached its lowest point since the 1960s. Wages at the low end of the pay scale rose faster than they had in decades. All of that has benefited groups that have historically been at a disadvantage in the labor market. The unemployment rate for Black Americans reached its lowest point on record in April, at 4.7 percent, and the gap between the unemployment rates of white and Black people was also the smallest ever measured. The share of working-age people participating in the labor market reached 83.3 percent, matching a level not seen since 2008. In recent months, that exceptional mismatch between the supply and demand for workers has been coming into balance.

Professional and business services added 43,000 jobs, though there was some variability below the headline number. While there were healthy gains in professional, scientific and technical services, there was a drop in administrative and support services, driven in large part by a loss of 23,000 jobs in temporary help services. That sector has been trending downward and has lost a net 174,000 jobs since March 2022, its peak. Leisure and hospitality employment increased by 31,000, below its average of 73,000 jobs per month for the last six months but still a notable addition. The industry, which is still about 400,000 jobs below its prepandemic level, has raced to accommodate consumers eager to unload money especially at restaurants and bars despite concerns about a pullback in spending.

With these revisions, employment in January and February combined is 17,000 lower than previously reported. The change in temporary help services employment in January was revised up from gain of +15,300 jobs to a gain of +16,600, and the previously estimated gain of +6,800 in February was revised down to a gain of +3,400.

When Biden took office, there were fewer jobs than unemployed job seekers. The number of job openings in March is set to be released May 2.

The labor force participation rate (the percentage of the total population over age 16 that is either employed or actively seeking work) has slowly recovered during Biden’s time, from 61.3% in January 2021 to 62.6% in March.

Key to Microsoft's approach is what it calls its “Prometheus model.” Named after the mythological hero who stole fire from the Greek gods, it's ...", "Microsoft’s Prometheus tooling is designed to provide a set of guardrails around AI tooling, with a focus on what the company called “prompt engineering.” If you look into early platform tools like the recently launched Azure OpenAI, the API to a generative AI like GPT is very simple: It’s a way to send a string of text to the service. What’s important is getting that string — the prompt — correct. It’s also interesting to see how the platform helps you find that prompt. With Bing’s OpenAI tools, it’s better to start with a relatively open-ended query and then refine your results. It’s an interactive platform that is designed to help you find what you need, and the best results come from those interactions. Simple queries are handed off to the traditional search algorithms, as there’s no value in using the compute resources required for an AI-powered search. Then there’s the larger question of training data. While large language models like GPT are trained on public data, that’s less important when it comes to working with the data stored in your own applications. Again, Azure OpenAI offers some clues, with the option to use a custom model that blends the existing GPT LLM with a selection of your own data. Both Dynamics and Microsoft 365 have their own data models, which would work well as part of an expanded Prometheus model, especially as Bing already uses that data in its enterprise search mode.", "Where OpenAI’s demo services only take input from a text box, Microsoft injects additional context, including location, date and time, while splitting queries up into multiple parallel searches, aiming to speed up requests and improve the quality of results. Results are parsed and used as inputs into the model, looking for fresh insights that can drive additional searches, an approach that Microsoft described as a “virtuous loop.” The initial implementation of this AI tooling is in both its Edge browser and Bing search engine. Microsoft gave a picture of how the service will eventually appear in the rest of the company’s productivity tooling. In Edge, a new Bing sidebar lets you take searches outside the traditional browser, giving a clue to how it could be implemented in the familiar Office applications. The new sidebar design Microsoft has been rolling out across Office is very much like the Bing AI tooling that’s being trialed in the developer release of the Edge browser. While Microsoft has yet to announce any plans to provide API-level access to this tooling, it would be surprising if it wasn’t on the company’s radar. Microsoft is first and foremost a platform company, and its use of generative AI is clearly setting a pointer to what it thinks its next platform should be — assistive AI.

It costs $20 a month. To date, the best way to access OpenAI’s language models on mobile has been to use Microsoft’s Bing app, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4-powered chatbot. An official app from ChatGPT will likely attract some of these users away from Microsoft, which has been using access to its chatbot as a way to lure people toward Bing and Edge. The launch of an official ChatGPT should also, hopefully, stop people from signing up for the countless spam and fake apps that purport to offer access to the chatbot on mobile. Of course, ChatGPT has the same issues on mobile as it does on the web. These include the bot’s tendency to fabricate information with complete confidence, and privacy fears. OpenAI only recently gave users the option to make conversations private, and the app’s homescreen (as seen above) still warns users not to share “sensitive info” on the app.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Apple's App Store has previously hosted several apps that use OpenAI's software, but none were from OpenAI itself.  ChatGPT is the best-known example of a \"large language model,\" a type of machine learning application that trains on terabytes of data to be able to return output of long paragraphs or computer code that looks like a human wrote it.  The app is free, although it includes a $20 per month in-app purchase through Apple for ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI's subscription that offers additional features.

The letter urged labs to take at least a six-month pause in artificial intelligence development due to the \"profound risks\" to society.  In February, Microsoft entered the AI chatbot realm with Bing AI search, which makes use of ChatGPT, and for which Microsoft earlier this week launched widgets on Android and iOS. Rival Google followed with AI Bard in March. The waitlist to try Bard has now been removed, with the service publicly available as of this week. Chinese giant Alibaba also unveiled a ChatGPT rival, with both Chinese and English capabilities, while Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk has created an artificial intelligence company called X.AI.  CNET has broken down the performance of ChatGPT, Bing and Google Bard to work out which AI chatbot is the most helpful.

The subscription offering was launched in February and costs $20 per month for the upgraded features, including access to ChatGPT even during peak times. The company says the rollout of the new app will start in the U.S. today but it will expand to other countries in the “coming weeks.” An Android version is also teased as “coming soon.” Image Credits: OpenAI (App Store screenshot) Image Credits: OpenAI (App Store screenshot) OpenAI had been rumored to be working on a mobile client, according to a February article by Semafor, which the company had then declined to comment on. The ChatGPT app’s launch comes at a time when major tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, are experimenting with AI, and in the case of Google and Microsoft, also integrating AI capabilities into their search engines — the latter through an expensive partnership with OpenAI, in fact. But being able to access ChatGPT directly on mobile outside of a search engine or browser could potentially shake up how people today use their phones to search and connect with information. One thing that could be compelling about OpenAI’s mobile app versus search apps’ AI integrations is its ad-free nature."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.", "Apple says that it can stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds, providing a \"virtually lag-free\" view of the world.   There is a thermal system inside the Vision Pro that is designed to quietly move air through the headset to control heat and optimize performance.  The Vision Pro headset will use dynamic random access memory or DRAM that is custom designed to support the R1 input processing chip. SK hynix will supply Apple with 1-gigabit low latency DRAM chips that have an increased number of input and output pins to minimize delays.  With the external battery pack, the Vision Pro can run for approximately two hours. Battery packs can be swapped out for additional power on the go, but the device ships with a single battery pack.   When plugged in to a power adapter, the Vision Pro can run all day. Apple Vision Pro runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple designed specifically for the headset. visionOS is designed to provide an \"infinite canvas\" with app windows able to go anywhere in the space surrounding the user.   Apple redesigned apps like Safari, FaceTime, Messages, and more to work in a 3D environment, plus the headset is able to run the full catalog of iPhone and iPad apps. iPhone and iPad apps aren't optimized for 3D, but can be used on the virtual canvas.", "Vision Pro is Apple's wearable \"spatial computing\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit.", "Optic ID can be used like Face ID for unlocking the device, authenticating purchases, and as a password alternative.  Apple included an exterior camera that is able to capture 3D video and 3D photos that are viewable in 3D on the Vision Pro. Apple says that these are like reliving a memory in person because of the \"incredible depth\" that's available.   The camera gives a clear indicator when recording is turned on so that the headset cannot be used to secretly record video. There are speakers on either side of the headset, with the speakers built into the straps that are connected to the frame. The speakers feature dual-driver audio pods that are positioned next to each ear, and they are able to analyze a room's acoustic properties to adapt the sound to match the space.  The speakers support spatial audio for an immersive surround sound experience, plus there are also six microphones for phone calls, video calls, and voice commands.  Apple Vision Pro is powered by a pair of chips. The main processor is the M2, which is the same chip that was first introduced in the 2022 MacBook Air. It is responsible for processing content, running the visionOS operating system, executing computer vision algorithms, and providing graphical content.   A second R1 chip is responsible for all of the information coming from the cameras, sensors, and microphones.", "You can see these, as well as loads of other details, in our 180-plus image gallery below: 1/189 1/189 The headset has a glass front and an aluminum frame, containing five sensors, 12 cameras, a 4K display for each eye, and a computer that’s apparently cooled with a fan. The headset mask (which Apple dubs a “Light Seal”) and strap (which Apple dubs a “Head Band”) are cloth-lined and modular, and Apple says they can flex to fit to a variety of face shapes and head sizes. The Head Band is ribbed and fits around the back of your head, and you can swap different sizes and styles of band. Zeiss has created custom optical inserts that magnetically attach to the lenses for people who wear glasses. It has an external battery that lasts up to two hours and can connect via a “supple woven cable” so it slips into a pocket, or you can plug it into external power and use it all day. Apple promises that the display will be unprecedentedly sharp and can deliver 4K video. The system uses an M2, but it also includes a new chip called the R1. You’re also not, Apple promises, isolated from people around you. The headset will display your eyes with a system called EyeSight, and if you’re in full VR, a glowing screen will obscure them to suggest you’re not available."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The headset is believed to be the same size as Meta’s Oculus Quest and focused on high-tech and high-performance. Additionally, it’s said to include an even more power-hungry processor than the M1 found on the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. VR is the headset’s primary focus, but it will also offer some AR functionality, per Bloomberg’s initial look at the product. Can Apple keep the AR industry alive?  The new product will find Apple competing directly against Meta’s Quest Pro (rumored for a release next month), and PlayStation VR. According to the filing, Apple’s headset could offer both gaming and FaceTime functionality, along with health and educational features. While Meta’s devices have been used for some medical training, they weren’t designed with such use cases in mind. Apple is holding a big event at its Cupertino HQ next week, with the iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 serving as headliners. A sneak peek of the new headset could also be on the agenda, as the company looks to entice developers to create content for the new category. Executives are believed to have already shown off a version of the product to shareholders.", "The Reality Processor would naturally refer to the custom Apple silicon designed for the device. The chip is expected to be similar to the M2 chip seen in the 2022 MacBook Air. The Information said the first-generation headset would also feature a special coprocessor to manage the imaging pipeline. Apple’s first media event of the fall will take place on September 7, where it will announce its first batch of new products for the holiday season. The headset is not expected to make an appearance, although anything’s possible as Apple will inevitably preview the headset months ahead of its actual release. What we do expect to see on September 7 is the iPhone 14 lineup and Apple Watch Series 8. The headset will most likely be announced in the spring of 2023.

After shattering the 36-hole birdie mark with 18, he could only muster five on the weekend, including two in the final round against seven bogeys. “I just didn’t have it today,” said the 34-year-old Fowler, whose engaging personality makes him one of the most-liked players in the game. “Iron play was very below average and didn’t make anything.

Clark told reporters this week that his mother’s advice to him before every tournament was to “play big.” He heeded that mantra this week, especially on the weekend when he found himself in the final pairing with Fowler each of the last two days.

The bogey on the par-5 eighth when he barely moved the ball on his third shot in thick greenside rough was reminiscent of his bogey save late Saturday on the 17th hole. Most observers were expecting McIlroy, Fowler or Scheffler – three of the biggest names in golf – to hoist the trophy at day’s end. They received the most boisterous roars on Sunday, but all three failed to match the adulation on the 7,359-yard George C. Thomas Jr. design that underwent a restoration by Gil Hanse in preparation for the first U.S. Open in Los Angeles since 1948.  Newly minted U.S. Open champion is congratulated by gracious fellow competitor Rickie Fowler after Sunday's final round.", "McClure is also targeting another golfer for his 2023 U.S. Open one and done picks that excels in big events against top flight competition.

World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler finished third, three shots behind Clark at seven-under and one ahead of Australian Cameron Smith in fourth.           Level in fifth with Fowler were Australian Min Woo Lee and England’s Tommy Fleetwood, who was mere inches away from leveling Fowler and Schauffele’s historic record following a blistering final round.           Fleetwood shot two eagles and four birdies to soar 32 places up the leaderboard, but saw his closing seven-foot birdie effort roll agonizingly wide to end on a 63.           Defending champion Matt Fitzpatrick finished tied-17th at one-under overall, as did last month’s PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka.           The fourth and final men’s major of the year, The Open Championship, gets underway at Royal Liverpool Golf Club on July 20.           After an agonizing bogey finish to his third round, any hopes Fowler had of wiping the slate clean were quickly dashed. The world No. 45 made a nightmare start as his first ever share of a 54-hole major lead evaporated, a string of errant tee shots compounding two bogeys across his first six holes."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13.

Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic.

The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80 percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20 percent.[1][2] The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones;[1] Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team.[3] Voters cannot select an entire unit.[4]  The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine.[5] Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL.[5] At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP.[6] Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy.", "Kupp didn’t play in the Rams’ 2018 Super Bowl run because of an ACL injury to his left knee, so he made the most of his first Super Bowl opportunity. \"In 2019, we walked off the field that last time after losing to the Patriots,\" Kupp said after his team’s victory. \"I wasn’t able to be part of that.

But what’s interesting about Donald, what makes him an all-time great and probably the true Super Bowl MVP, is his ability to control and direct that feeling in such an intelligent way. There is a fascinating restraint-and-release, shift-and-surge control with which Donald plays. Anyone can be a wild man, but Donald has a regulator that allows him to be at his most powerful and detonating when it counts, to outsmart and outmaneuver the opponent in the face of all the violence to ruin the most important play. That’s what makes him “an official game wrecker,” as Morris calls him. Recall a close, heated 2018 game between the Rams and the Seattle Seahawks, when a fight broke out near the Rams’ sideline between Donald and one of the Seahawks, Justin Britt. As the two men began shoving, other players surrounded them. A thrown punch might have meant ejection from the game. Rams Coach Sean McVay ran into the melee and frantically peeled players away trying to get to his star defender — “Get out!” he ordered, “Get out!” — until he reached Donald. He took Donald by the arm, got in front of him. “This is where you’re great. It shows up right here,” McVay exhorted him. “Aaron, love you, this is why you’re great.", "7] The most recent Super Bowl MVP, from Super Bowl LVII held on February 12, 2023, is Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts.[9] Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen.[10][11] Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award. However since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.[13]", "This article was published more than 1 year ago Aaron Donald grabbed Joe Burrow by the waist and swung him around three times as if he was the lead and Burrow was the follow in a waltz pairing. Around and around Burrow went, in that violent spin before he hit the ground, the last dance in an intimate un-love story. The strange pairing of ferocity and joy, like everything else Donald did with so much intensity in the Super Bowl, cut through all the overhyped gigantism of the occasion with memorable physical detail. Super Bowls have become so colossal in scale and technology that the players can seem as remote as game animations, framed figments in 4K HDR video. That seemed especially so at SoFi Stadium with that haloed canopy ceiling and the image-casting LEDs, the panoramic fisheye lenses and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson booming about “4.5 billion years” as if the game was a speeding piece of space junk. But then here came Donald leading the Los Angeles Rams with such palpable sweat and yearning want. Then running off the field triumphantly pointing at his ring finger and in the postgame interview saying, as those finely distinguishable tears rolled down his face along with the perspiration, “We’re going to play in the confetti for a minute, man.” Then the big man did that, sat in that blizzard of colorful snow with arms clutching his children."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}
