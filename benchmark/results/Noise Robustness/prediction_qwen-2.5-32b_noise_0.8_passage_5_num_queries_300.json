At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie.

On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.

And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said.

Patrick Mahomes and the elite offense of the Chiefs’ were stymied by the Bucs’ defense, recording zero touchdowns in the big game.  Meanwhile, Brady grabbed his seventh Super Bowl ring by throwing for 201 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Rob Gronkowski six times for 67 yards and two touchdowns.  Super Bowl LVII is set to take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., home of the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the fourth Super Bowl hosted in the Phoenix metropolitan area, with the last one coming in 2015 for Super Bowl XLIX.  The 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls are also set. Super Bowl LVIII will be hosted by Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Raiders play, and Super Bowl LVIX will be at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, home of the Saints.", "Super Bowl XLIV, slated for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants (New York Jets) could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]", "Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a stadium that was not home to an NFL team to host the Super Bowl (see above).  Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Stadium; one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for Super Bowl XLVI; and one in the New York area—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium.", "Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium. Starting with the selection of the Super Bowl XXVIII venue on May 23, 1990, the league has given preference in awarding the Super Bowl to brand new or recently renovated NFL stadiums, alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums.  To date only two teams have qualified for a Super Bowl at their home stadiums: the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won Super Bowl LV hosted at Raymond James Stadium (selected on May 23, 2017), and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams the following season, who won Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Before that, the closest any team had come to accomplishing this feat were the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, who reached the NFC Championship Game but lost to the Eagles. In that instance, U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season (which the Vikings won); all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium hosted another playoff game in the same postseason were all Wild Card games.", "Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles.

Those structures range from luge tracks and skating rinks to snowboard courses. The 12 ice and snow venues are scattered between Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, which includes a large mountain resort. Test events were held at those venues this year to fine-tune them for  competition, organizers said.

The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Project Bondi, developed with Samsung, will likely rely on Android, while it is still unclear which operating system will be used for the more distant cloud-streaming headset.

Moreover, the acquisition is a wake-up call to its competitors.   MicroLED is a promising emerging technology for displays that are already seen as the best choice for next-generation AR displays due to its greater energy efficiency, availability for bright environments, and vibrant colors.   In the display field, OLED was once seen as the most ideal choice for AR applications due to its high pixel density and the advantage of no backlight. However, the limitation of OLEDs in AR applications is that most AR headset devices are used in sunlit environments.

Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads.

The RSC will help the company build new and better AI models, working across hundreds of different languages, and to develop new augmented reality tools. Developing the next generation of advanced AI will require powerful new computers capable of quintillions of operations per second. Meta’s researchers have already started using RSC to train large models in natural-language processing (NLP) and computer vision for research, with the aim of one day training models with trillions of parameters across Meta’s businesses, from content-moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, to augmented-reality features that will one day be available in the metaverse.

AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload. The demand for data centres, AI, and ML (machine learning) among enterprises such as Government and educational entities, is witnessing exponential growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic boosting the demand for supercomputers, Mordor Intelligence said in a report.", "At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.) These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe)."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

After wins against Daria Saville, Leylah Fernandez, and Victoria Azarenka, Świątek lost to Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals.[5] She was scheduled to play at the Sydney International, seeded sixth, and her first match was scheduled to be against Emma Raducanu,[6] but she pulled out of the tournament due to a rib injury.[7]  Świątek entered into the Australian Open, where she was seeded seventh.

Swiatek, who looked extremely nervous before the match began, looked anything but once the rackets started swinging. She came out strong, showing off all the skills we know her for: explosive movement, pinpoint precision and a soft touch. By comparison, Jabeur, who looked comfortable and happy before the match started, came out looking flat and tentative. It wasn't until Swiatek was up 3-0 that Jabeur got on the board. Then, in the fifth game of the first set, Jabeur hit four winners, each one perfectly placed along the singles sideline. All Swiatek could do with those is watch them bounce as Jabeur narrowed the gap at 3-2. Unfortunately, that was the last game Jabeur won in the first set. Swiatek was able to reach balls that most people couldn't even try for, while Jabeur couldn't stop hitting the ball into the net at the most vital moments.

In November 2011, the Russian spacecraft Fobos-Grunt, destined for Mars and Phobos, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Russian spacecraft carried with it an attached secondary spacecraft, the Yinghuo-1, which was intended to become China's first Mars orbiter (Fobos-Grunt also carried experiments from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the American Planetary Society). However, Fobos-Grunt's main propulsion unit failed to boost the Mars-bound stack from its initial Earth parking orbit and the combined multinational spacecraft and experiments eventually reentered the atmosphere of Earth in January 2012.[citation needed] In 2014, China subsequently began an independent Mars project.[43]  The new Mars spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander with an attached rover, was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and is managed by the National Space Science Centre (NSSC) in Beijing.[44] The mission was formally approved in 2016.[45]", "The orbiter will image the landing site and determine the conditions on the ground in preparation for the landing.

With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods.

This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be.

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas.

After months of waffling, lawsuits, verbal mudslinging and the near miss of a full blown trial, Elon Musk now owns Twitter.", "Musk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal.", "It’s not obvious to me how, if he bought Twitter, he would then be better able to get his message out, or better able to tell a story in a way that is good for Tesla and good for his economic interests. But it’s not obvious that it wouldn’t be. And he’s a really smart guy. One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that.

That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.", "The 2022 Virginia Tech Hokies football team represented Virginia Tech during the 2022 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Hokies were led by first-year head coach Brent Pry. They played their home games at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Virginia, competing as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).  The Hokies finished the 2021 season 6–7, 4–4 in ACC play to finish in a tie for third place in the Coastal division.[1] They received an invitation to the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl where they lost to Maryland 54–10.[2]  On November 16, 2021, the school fired head coach Justin Fuente after six years as head coach.[3] Assistant coach J. C. Price was named the interim coach and coached the Hokies in the Pinstripe Bowl.[4] On November 30, the school named Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry the team's new head coach.[5]  [7][8]  The game was canceled due to the 2022 University of Virginia shooting, which killed 3 players on Virginia's team. Roster Last update: 5/28/23", "“I’ve always heard good things about Brent. … Good energy. Cares about the players. And obviously a good track record at Penn State. So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players. Tech’s average recruiting ranking in the past four years is 45th nationally and seventh in the ACC, a tick below NC State and Georgia Tech.", "The 2022 class was better, highlighted by local lineman Gunner Givens, though two higher-profile commitments (running back Ramon Brown and quarterback Alex Orji) flipped after Fuente’s ouster. The group was heavy on both lines, with the Hokies well aware of the shortcomings on the roster. Big picture, what’s clear is that Pry and Co. intend to make Virginia a focus again for the Hokies. In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.", "The problem has always been that Virginia Tech’s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.  Before we launch into the charts for players, let’s look at the critical two coaches who will have the most to say about how the 2022 Hokie Offense runs, and in particular how the subject of this article will be managed."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.", "Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, told Cointelegraph that he thinks the bipartisan bill is “terrific,” further noting that the bill contains modest differences in how stablecoins are treated compared with his stablecoin approach, which was drafted in April this year. Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "© 2023 | Terms & Conditions | Privacy & Cookies Policy", "Despite the crypto winter, the conference drew in 17,000 people to discuss the crypto regulatory landscape, Web3 development and the future of digital assets.   “Everything is bigger in Texas” proved to be true during Consensus 2022. The crypto conference took place June 9–12 in Austin, Texas, this year, attracting over 20,000 people from across the globe, despite the 100-degree plus weather. According to the event sponsors, Consensus 2018, which was held at the Hilton Hotel in New York, had previously drawn in almost 9,000 attendees.  Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia — the Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the event this year speaks volumes. “New York has sent a lot of this industry fleeing to places like Austin, Wyoming and Miami. It will be interesting to see if New York makes a comeback.” Aside from its new location, current market conditions were another defining factor of the event. However, attendees remained optimistic about the crypto ecosystem as a whole. In general, new projects and the rise of Web3 were the main discussion points rather than cryptocurrency prices. Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful — a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace — told Cointelegraph that crypto winters allow for building phases to start, which he fully supports. “We are now seeing projects build platforms that are real and empowering.", "This has been very compelling to Mayor Adler,” he shared. Demirors also pointed out that she is excited about the advancement of crypto infrastructures, such as new data centers, semiconductors and the overall “plumbing” that makes cryptocurrency and any technology function properly. “We need to make sure the U.S. is a friendly jurisdiction for people to develop not only software, but also hardware to deploy at scale,” she said.  While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Verrilli mentioned during a press conference at Consensus last week that he is trying to take public policy and move it in a constructive direction.

Many horses went out on a blistering pace, because so many trainers and jockeys had decided their best move was to get close to the lead for the opening portions of the race. The biggest indicator that this was going to be a wild finish probably came when track announcer Larry Collmus briefly stopped his rundown of which horse was where in the field at the half-mile mark. “The opening half-mile was — WHOA! — blazing fast, 45.36 seconds,” Collmus said. Those fuel tanks were emptying far faster than anticipated. At that half-mile mark, Rich Strike was ahead of only two horses. He was sitting in 18th place.

The automaker also warned of continued supply constraints that could hamper future production, despite the recent openings of its Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas that will build the Model Y. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” the automaker said in its financial outlook.

Hatch—the Chairman Emeritus of the Hatch Foundation, former President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, and longest-serving Senator in Utah history (1977-2019). Senator Hatch passed away at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 23, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah, surrounded by family. Upon the Senator’s passing, the Hatch Foundation issued the following statements:  “Senator Orrin G. Hatch personified the American Dream,” said Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Hatch Foundation. “Born the son of a carpenter and plaster lather, he overcame the poverty of his youth to become a United States Senator. With the hardships of his upbringing always fresh in his mind, he made it his life’s mission to expand freedom and opportunity for others—and the results speak for themselves. From tax and trade to religious liberty and healthcare, few legislators have had a greater impact on American life than Orrin Hatch. He was a profoundly positive influence in the lives of those he served, whether they were the constituents he helped over four decades of casework, the hundreds of interns he sponsored in both Utah and DC, or the robust network of Hatch staffers who carry on his legacy to this day. Senator Hatch touched the hearts of countless individuals, and I know I speak for all of them when I say he will be dearly missed.", "When Hatch announced he would not seek re-election in 2018, he said \"every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves.\" After moving to Utah in the early 1970s, Hatch — a former bishop in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — ran for his first public office in 1976 and narrowly upset Democratic Sen. Frank Moss. In 1982, he held off challenger Ted Wilson, the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake City, to win a second term by a solid margin. He was never seriously challenged again. Orrin Grant Hatch was born in 1934 in Pittsburgh. He married Elaine Hanson in 1957 and graduated from Brigham Young University in 1959. He received a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1962 and was a partner in the law firm of Thomson, Rhodes and Grigsby in that city until 1969. Later, he was a partner in the Salt Lake City firm of Hatch & Plumb. He had six children: Brent, Marcia, Scott, Kimberly, Alysa and Jess.", "Hatch left office, Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian commendation. The president had earlier shrunk the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, a move sought by Mr. Hatch and other Utah officials and opposed by environmental and American Indian groups. “I’m approving the Bears Ears recommendation for you, Orrin,” Trump told him in a 2017 phone call, Mr. Hatch reported. Orrin Grant Hatch was born March 22, 1934, in Pittsburgh. His parents had nine children, two of whom died in infancy. Mr. Hatch’s brother Jesse was killed in World War II when his B-24 bomber went down in enemy action over Europe, a loss that the future senator, 10 years old at the time, said had a lifelong impact on him. His father was a metal lather and union member. The family, as the future senator often recounted, had little money and lived in a “ramshackle house” built by his parents out of recycled lumber, one side adorned by a large sign for Meadow Gold Ice Cream. As a boy, he was scrawny and was pushed around by a schoolyard bully. As Mr. Hatch told the story, he filled a duffel bag with sand, hung it from a tree and spent after-school hours learning how to throw punches, later moving on to amateur bouts.", "Army Air Forces nose turret gunner with the 725th Bombardment Squadron who was killed on February 7, 1945, when the B-24 he was aboard was shot down over Austria.[3][5][6][7]  Hatch, who grew up in poverty,[8] was the first in his family to attend college; he attended Brigham Young University and earned a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1959.

You call him home.\"[12] Hatch ran on the promise of term limits[13] and argued that many senators, including Moss, had lost touch with their constituents.[14]", "He and his wife, Elaine, were married for more than 60 years and were the proud parents of six children and dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He served as a Bishop and missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Orrin G. Hatch was born on March 22, 1934, in Homestead Park, Pennsylvania—just outside of Pittsburgh. His mother was a homemaker and his father was a union carpenter and plaster lather. In humble circumstances, they raised nine children in the aftermath of the Great Depression.  Hatch’s childhood, though happy, was also marked by poverty and significant hardship. When Hatch was just ten years old, he was deeply impacted by the loss of his older brother, Jesse Hatch, who was killed in action in Europe during World War II. After Jesse’s death, Hatch resolved to live two lives—one for himself and one for his brother.  This resolve drove Hatch to succeed in sports and other extracurricular activities. In high school, he played on the varsity basketball team, fought as an amateur boxer, and served as student body president. He brought his passion for music, athletics, and student government with him to Brigham Young University in 1952. To pay his way through college, Hatch worked as a janitor during the school year and as a journeyman lather in the summers."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

The signatures were submitted to the Constitutional Council, which is the sole authority to designate participants.[10]  Following the 2017 presidential election, The Republicans (LR) sent its members a questionnaire on the topic of the \"re-foundation\" of the party; of the 40,000 respondents, 70% voted against an open primary like that which was held in 2016 to determine the party nominee.[11] In a document dated 17 October 2017, the Socialist Party (PS) wrote that the financing of the 2022 presidential campaign was not assured despite \"economic restructuring\" but still planned to spend €12,000,000, the maximum legally permitted before the first round.

Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "When you try to take a photo with the main camera and are standing very close to a subject, the iPhone 14 Pro switches to the ultrawide camera and crops the framing to mimic the main camera. This allows for a closer focus, which is great for close-up shots of small things.  Macro mode lets you get within inches of your subject and keep it in focus, like this Lego car. Last year's 13 Pro had a similar feature, but with the new ultrawide, macro photos have better image quality, especially in medium and low light. Another macro photo from the 14 Pro. The 14 Pro nails the focus on Lego Batman in this macro photo. The telephoto camera is basically identical to the one on last year's 13 Pro, but it gets a lift from the 14 Pro's Photonic Engine. Under good lighting, like in the picture below, the telephoto camera takes good photos. Notice in particular the colors and how the camera handles skin tones. A telephoto shot of folks noshing in a parklet. As with the ultrawide, image quality is a step behind the main camera -- especially in dimmer environments. I took this photo of the Embarcadero's Ferry Building during blue hour, with the 14 Pro's telephoto camera. Below is a Portrait mode picture of Maisie the cat taken indoors with the telephoto camera.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro.", "One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an “advanced quad-pixel sensor.” However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW.", "Impressively, the TrueDepth sensor also retains incredibly precise depth data sensing, despite its much smaller package in the Dynamic Island cutout area.  This is one of the times where Apple glosses over a very significant technological leap that a hugely talented team no doubt worked hard on. The competing Android flagship phones have not followed Apple down the technological path of high-precision, infrared-based Face ID, as it requires large sensors that create screen cutouts.  The ‘notch’ had shrunk in the last generation of iPhones, but this far smaller array retains incredible depth sensing abilities that we haven’t seen another product even approximate. And while shipping a software feat — the dynamic island deserves all the hype it gets — Apple also shipped a significant camera upgrade that every user will notice in day to day usage. Time to break into that large camera bump on the rear of iPhone 14 Pro. The ultra-wide camera, introduced with iPhone 11 in 2019, has long played a background role to the main wide camera due to its smaller sensor and lack of sharpness.  Last year, Apple surprised us by giving the entire ultra-wide package a significant upgrade: a more complex lens design allowed for autofocus and extremely-close focus for macro shots, and a larger sensor collected more light and allowed for far more detailed shots.

After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual.

Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases — 79 pounds of tools — on my front porch. I couldn’t believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple’s paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started.

The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products.

(During the intervening years, Muybridge would stand trial for the murder of his wife’s lover and be acquitted on the grounds that it was justifiable homicide — but let’s leave that for a future Peele film.) By Muybridge’s recollection, the series of photographs that became known as “The Horse in Motion” was first published in 1878. The next year, he would begin holding presentations that put his sequential photographs — or, technically, artistic reproductions of them — in motion, using a device he called the zoopraxiscope, a forerunner of the film projector. And as far as “The Horse in Motion” is concerned, some (though not all) of the stills held at the Library of Congress indicate the names of the riders. But those photographs are not the images shown in “Nope.” The Muybridge works in the movie, with the unnamed rider, are from “Plate Number 626,” part of a later series of locomotion studies that Muybridge began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1884 and published in 1887.", "The head horse wrangler — Bobby Lovgren — is named, but the horses are omitted. In a film that powerfully explores the ethics of animal actors, for those it depends upon to be erased in this way is strange.

Before this, OJ was trying to accrue some money by selling horses to his neighbor, Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun), who lives in the same Agua Dulce valley, just down the road from the Haywoods. Although the Haywood siblings are the film's main characters, in many ways, Ricky “Jupe” Park is the core character of Nope, for his backstory, and the current life that he leads personify the main themes that Nope discusses. “Jupe” Park is a washed-up child star who is desperately clinging to fame and relevance by running a self-exploitative theme park called \"Jupiter's Claim\" based on a film he was in in the 90s. Having resided in the Agua Dulce valley for a while, Jupe has encountered Jean Jacket the UFO, and learned that Jean Jacket likes to eat horses. At his theme park, Jupe runs a live show called “The Starlight Lasso Experience.” During the show, Jupe summons Jean Jacket. To do this, he buys horses from the Haywood ranch, and unbeknownst to the Haywoods, Jupe uses them as sacrificial bait for Jean Jacket to come down and eat the horses in front of a live audience.", "So while the images in “Nope” aren’t, strictly speaking, the horse ride that gave birth to cinema, the pioneering actor, animal wrangler and stunt man shown in them probably is unknown.

Sometimes people mistook Jeffrey for an actual guy in prison, which to me shows how much the outfits matter. That piece of cloth tells people you’re guilty.

The third iteration of Meta’s AI chatbot Blender Bot and the company’s answer to Google’s LaMDA has taken a rather unpleasant but not unexpected turn. Just a week after its launch, Meta’s Blender Bot 3 has turned on its creator and is already spewing marginally racist comments. Blender Bot 3 was released by the social networking giant on Friday, August 5. The conversational AI is designed to converse with humans about “nearly any topic.” Like Blender Bot 2, the latest upgrade also features the ability to browse the internet, is trained on the OPT-175B language model (which is 58x the size of Blender Bot 2), and has long-term memory.  It also eliminates the limitations such as forgetfulness (which surprisingly makes machine learning models efficient when not used in chatbots). It has self-learning capabilities that allow it “to improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses.” Well, yes and no. While it is entirely plausible that the underlying AI tech helps it to ‘learn,’ it seems like Blender Bot 3 cannot differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not. At least that’s what its recent responses to some people conveyed.", "For example, you can react to each chat message in our BlenderBot 3 demo by clicking either the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons. Choosing a thumbs-down lets you explain why you disliked the message — whether it was off-topic, nonsensical, rude, spam-like or something else. You can also submit feedback in the chat itself.  To improve BlenderBot 3’s ability to engage with people, we trained it with a large amount of publicly available language data. Many of the datasets used were collected by our own team, including one new dataset consisting of more than 20,000 conversations with people predicated on more than 1,000 topics of conversation. We trained BlenderBot 3 to learn from conversations to improve upon the skills people find most important — from talking about healthy recipes to finding child-friendly amenities in the city. When the chatbot’s response is unsatisfactory, we collect feedback on it. Using this data, we can improve the model so that it doesn’t repeat its mistakes. We understand that not everyone who uses chatbots has good intentions, so we also developed new learning algorithms to distinguish between helpful responses and harmful examples. Over time, we will use this technique to make our models more responsible and safe for all users. Compared with its predecessors, we found that BlenderBot 3 improved by 31% on conversational tasks. It’s also twice as knowledgeable, while being factually incorrect 47% less often.", "“Initial experiments already show that as more people interact with the model, the more it learns from its experiences and the better and safer it becomes over time,” the company says, “though safety remains an open problem.” Let’s pause and take in those last few words before continuing. When Meta announced the project, my eyebrows raised slightly at the sample conversation it had chosen to illustrate the post with – a chat between a user and BlenderBot in which the AI, well, lies. When asked what it’s doing it says “I’ve been working on my new book all night”, and follows up with the claim the book will be its ninth, with previous novels including “a modern retelling of pride and prejudice”. The question of what it means to want an AI to tell the truth is a tricky one. As we saw in June with Google’s LaMDA, the fundamental goal of these models is to provide a user with the appropriate text to finish their prompt: if you ask a machine what it did at the weekend, the machine is probably correct in assuming that you want to engage in light role-play, rather than stick to the facts. Nonetheless, the decision to advertise BlenderBot with a conversation in which it lied to a user is suggestive of the attitude the company is taking with it. The idea is that, by releasing the project as a chatbot on the internet, Meta has more leeway to experiment without risking negative outcomes.", "However, LaMDA, the other advanced conversational AI by the search giant, was mired in controversy when the company tried to suppress the fact that LaMDA believes it is a person and wants to be respected. Blake Lemoine, the Google techie tasked with determining if LaMDA had racist or hateful tendencies in its conversational responses, blew the whistle and was ultimately suspended by Google. South Korean startup Scatter Lab’s Luda chatbot also turned racist and responded with anti-LGBTQ remarks and was temporarily shut down last year.

The Wall Street Journal has reported BlenderBot 3 told one of its journalists that Donald Trump was, and will always be, the US president.  A business Insider journalist said the chatbot called Mr Zuckerberg \"creepy\".  Meta has made the BlenderBot 3 public, and risked bad publicity, for a reason. It needs data.  \"Allowing an AI system to interact with people in the real world leads to longer, more diverse conversations, as well as more varied feedback,\" Meta said in a blog post.  Chatbots that learn from interactions with people can learn from their good and bad behaviour. In 2016 Microsoft apologised after Twitter users taught its chatbot to be racist. Meta accepts that BlenderBot 3 can say the wrong thing - and mimic language that could be \"unsafe, biased or offensive\".

Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[10]  OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[11] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[12] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[13] in downstream scaling laws.", "Here’s what I see the recently released GPT-4 having to offer those looking to be at the forefront in their industries. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 \"passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%.\" On Twitter, I've seen many developers testing out GPT-4 with requests for it to code old-school arcade games. While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions. For example, users can input a handmade sketch into the AI chatbot, and it will transform the sketch into a functional web page.", "Sam Altman was interviewed recently for the StrictlyVC program, where he confirms that OpenAI is working on a video model, which sounds incredible but could also lead to serious negative outcomes. While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it much  longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it’s frustrating and I totally get that.” Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm. One unconfirmed rumor is that it will have 100 trillion parameters (compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters).", "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered \"GPT-n\" series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API being provided via a waitlist.[1] As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\"), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.[2]: 2   Observers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems.[3] Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input.[4] OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.[5]  OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

REUTERS/Sam Mircovich Tesla released FSD Beta to nearly all of its 400,000 FSD customers in the United States and Canada in the fourth quarter, when it recognized FSD revenue of $324 million. It said it expects to recognize nearly $1 billion of deferred revenue that remains over time as software updates are delivered. Musk has positioned FSD technology as one of several artificial intelligence initiatives at Tesla. Last May, in an interview with members of a Tesla owners club, Musk called full self driving \"essential\" for the company. \"It’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\" NHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. NHTSA said on Thursday despite the FSD recall its \"investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot and associated vehicle systems remains open and active.\" Tesla said in \"certain rare circumstances ... the feature could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing certain driving maneuvers.", "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Tesla’s increasing the price of its Full-Self Driving (FSD) software to $15,000. In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features. FSD doesn’t make a vehicle fully autonomous; it requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road at all times. The price of Tesla’s FSD beta has slowly crept up over the years, and cost $5,000 upon launch.", "But Tesla feels that the feature, which the company says remains in testing (or “beta”) despite its wide release, will be worth much more than even the price it’s selling for now.            “The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,” Musk wrote on Twitter in 2020. “[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000.”            But “full self-driving” wasn’t close to what Al-Rawi heard from Musk, who has claimed every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away.            Al-Rawi said it was stressful to use the “full self-driving” beta because the software would sometimes try to hit curbs or drive on the wrong side of the road. His car would brake unexpectedly at times, triggering road rage from others.             “He promised your car can be a taxi. This is going to be generating income,” Al-Rawi said. “Unfortunately, none of this happened.”             Al-Rawi still believes that Tesla’s driver-assist features are better than any other automaker. He calls the automaker’s lane-keeping feature “fantastic.” The “full self-driving” feature, which navigates local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, is where Al-Rawi had problems.", "FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged. The main attraction is \"autosteer on city streets,\" which lets a Tesla navigate around complex urban environments automatically, if imperfectly. Tesla has never disclosed how many people buy or subscribe to the premium FSD option. In the company's last earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said: \"As of now, we've deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets -- to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.\" NHTSA and Tesla communications say the system is something much simpler: a \"SAE level 2 driver support feature that can provide steering and braking/acceleration support to the driver under certain operating limitations.\" The safety recall report notes, \"the driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene (e.g., steer, brake or accelerate) as needed to maintain safe operation of the vehicle.\" Shares of Tesla fell a little more than 1% on the news, then quickly recovered.

We reviewed it recently: It's one of the best immersive gaming experiences we've ever had, and has some great games already, but it also costs more than the PlayStation 5 itself. Yeah, you read that right: The PSVR 2 costs $550. It's expensive, but if you're OK with tethering to a PlayStation 5 with a long cable, this could be the hardware for you, as opposed to waiting for the Meta Quest 3 or Apple's expected VR headset.  The PSVR 2 isn't wireless, but its higher-res HDR OLED display and advanced vibrating controllers, along with perks like eye tracking and in-headset rumble, give it a lot of hardware advantages.

But as I unboxed the device and began to see the same familiar design hallmarks that defined PlayStation’s first headset, I could quickly see why Sony opted not to brand it with a distinct name like the PlayStation Quest. The headset doesn’t reinvent Sony’s approach to VR so much as it iterates on a first draft. It’s a true hardware sequel. That approach puts PSVR2 in a potentially polarizing spot. Those who love the first version and use it as their sole VR device will be stunned by its major technical upgrade. Brand new releases like Horizon Call of the Mountain look astonishing, and I’d wager that you won’t get a clearer picture or more comfortable experience from any other headset at its price point. Serious VR stalwarts, on the other hand, might come away with a different perspective.

Carousel of Time also weaves in another one of Evancho’s Clouds covers, “The Gallery.”  When choosing songs from Mitchell’s catalog, Evancho gravitated to songs that immersed her the most. “Picking them was just basically listening to the songs and seeing which ones hit me hard in the chest and gave me chills, and made me feel deeply as I was listening to them,” ” shares Evancho. “I wanted to get across Joni’s beautiful music with a little bit of Jackie in there. I wanted to marry the two.” Slipping into Mitchell’s Blue era, Evancho takes on the title track, along with “River,” and “A Case of You,” off her iconic album, love stories inspired by Mitchell’s relationship with James Taylor. Mitchell’s 1970 album, Ladies of the Canyon, gets attention with Evancho’s tender acoustic wrap on “For Free,” “The Circle Game,” and “Rainy Night House.", "SEE ALSO: JACKIE EVANCHO CONTINUES HER COMEBACK WITH ANOTHER JONI MITCHELL COVER Evancho recently chatted with Talent Recap about the new project, saying that Mitchell is an artist she’s “been very inspired by for a very long time.” She added that something she loves about Mitchell is that she’s “so authentic.” “You know, even for the time period, she did not care what anyone said, as long as she was content with the music,” Evancho shared. “So I think it’s appropriate for the point in my life that I’m going through, and I’m excited to see what everyone thinks of it.” Evancho also shared that she’s “been doing a lot of songwriting,” confirming that fans can expect another album of original songs at some point. As she said, “I will not release until all these originals are done and it is nothing but my work.” The music, the style, the genre, and the essence all fit perfectly with Jackie’s incredible, ethereal voice.

We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.", "Carousel of Time is the ninth studio album from classical crossover singer Jackie Evancho. What’s especially impressive is that Evancho is only twenty-two years old! She first came to national prominence when she was a runner up on America’s Got Talent at ten years of age. Her voice was spectacular, and a big part of the draw was hearing that amazing sound coming from such a young person.  But Jackie Evancho is no longer a child, and in Carousel of Time she turns her fantastic voice to the music of Joni Mitchell. Mitchell, a major force in the counterculture music of the 1960s, had a remarkable knack for writing unique melodies along with thoughtful and insightful lyrics which explored relationships and reflections on life. Even though the melodies were catchy, Mitchell’s tunes always highlighted the lyrics. The popular “Both Sides Now” is a prime example. So, by covering ten of Mitchell’s compositions, Evancho has given herself the opportunity to create an album which sounds like more than just an opportunity to show off her voice. Evancho has had a difficult couple of years, breaking her back in a car accident and recently revealing that she has an eating disorder. The sensitivity with which she delivers these songs suggests that there is something about them that resonates deeply with her. Consequently, in hearing her sing them, they resonate with us as well. (Melody Place)       Robert J.", "Yes, Jackie started to have fame when she wasn’t even a teenager, and now at age 22, has been battling eating disorders for a while now. But Carousel of Time is Jackie’s own glimpse of hope after a dark season, a reminder that songs like Joni’s ‘Both Sides Now’ or ‘River’, could heal someone all the more than they may even realise. Yes, Jackie has a long way to go for complete and full healing from this eating disorder. But she’s nevertheless well on her way. An artist that is well beyond her years, musically and sonically, this is a must-purchase, especially if you’ve been a fan of Jackie’s material in the past and are eager to see what she’s doing now in the meantime, between originally written projects. Well done Jackie for this emotional, compelling, and heartfelt album. Maybe, just maybe, people can see that Joni’s music (and Jackie’s originals and covers) still has meaning and purpose even now, compared to whence, when and where these songs were written and originally recorded all those years ago. Looking forward to the next original album, whenever that arises. Here’s hoping this album continues to impact and influence, until then.   3 songs to listen to: Circle Game, Both Sides Now, A Case of You Score: 4."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Animated programs have the option to compete in broader program categories such as Outstanding Comedy Series, but cannot also submit for Outstanding Animation Program in the same year.[citation needed] The Simpsons, for instance, unsuccessfully submitted the episodes \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" and \"Mr. Plow\" in 1993 and 1994[1] while Family Guy was successfully nominated in 2009.[2] Several animated programs won Outstanding Children's Program prior to 1979 and, in the years since, Rugrats, Winnie the Pooh specials and Star Wars Rebels have been nominated for that award.  Prior to 1989, all of the nominated programs were specials produced outside the confines of a running series. The category was divided into programs \"one hour or less\" and \"more than one hour\" from 1989 to 2009, with episodes of running series becoming eligible. Programs that are 15 minutes or less were given their own category, Outstanding Short Form Animated Program, in 2008.[citation needed]", "These shows have not only won the hearts of viewers but have also garnered critical acclaim and accolades from industry professionals.

In fact, some animated shows have proven to be just as good, if not better, than their live-action counterparts.

He had been living in home detention for at least four years, according to unsealed court documents.

The penalty will be the largest to date handed down by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), the primary European data regulator for the social media giant. It is the third fine in the past year against a subsidiary of Meta, following sanctions of €17 million (then-U.S. $18.6 million) in March against Meta Ireland (formerly Facebook Ireland) and €225 million (then-U.S. $267 million) in September 2021 against WhatsApp. The Instagram fine will be the second largest imposed under the GDPR, behind a €746 million (U.S. $739 million) penalty weighed against Amazon in Luxembourg last year. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Irish DPC confirmed it adopted its final decision Friday regarding the Instagram fine. Full details in the case are expected to be published next week. A spokesperson for Meta said the company intends to appeal the decision. “While we’ve engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated,” the spokesperson said. “We’re continuing to carefully review the rest of the decision.", "TikTok, which also set up a E.U. hub in Ireland, is the subject of another investigation there. The fine issued on Monday stems from an investigation started last year by Irish regulators into reports that Facebook had not safeguarded its platform against being “scraped” for information, leading to the publication on an online hacker forum of data that included users’ names, locations and birth dates, in violation of rules that require companies to safeguard personal information. Meta said in a statement that “unauthorized data scraping is unacceptable and against our rules.” The company said it had changed its policies to prevent such practices. Meta did not say whether it would appeal the decision, as it has for the Instagram and WhatsApp penalties. Meta is not the only tech giant facing scrutiny. Last year, Amazon was fined nearly €750 million over its online advertising practices by regulators in Luxembourg, where it has its European headquarters. In January, Google was fined €150 million by French regulators because users were not given an adequate way to decline so-called cookie trackers used by online advertisers to trace a person’s internet browsing history.

The FTC now says this has not been the case. The 2020 privacy order, which required Facebook to pay a $5 billion fine, required an independent assessor to evaluate the company's privacy practices. The FTC said the assessor \"identified several gaps and weaknesses in Facebook's privacy program.\" The FTC also said Facebook, from late 2017 until 2019, \"misrepresented that parents could control whom their children communicated with through its Messenger Kids product.\" \"Despite the company's promises that children using Messenger Kids would only be able to communicate with contacts approved by their parents, children in certain circumstances were able to communicate with unapproved contacts in group text chats and group video calls,\" the FTC said.  As part of the proposed changes to the FTC's 2020 order, Meta would also be required to pause launching new products and services without \"written confirmation from the assessor that its privacy program is in full compliance\" with the order.

An investigation conducted by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) found the video-sharing app may have breached data protection law between May 2018 and July 2020. The ICO issued TikTok with a “notice of intent”, a precursor to handing down a potential fine, which could be up to £27m. If TikTok were to be fined this amount it would be the largest in the ICO’s history, exceeding the record £20m handed to British Airways two years ago after an incident in 2018 that saw the personal details of more than 400,000 customers compromised by hackers. The maximum fine the ICO can impose would be based on a calculation of 4% of TikTok’s global annual turnover. The regulator’s “provisional view” is that TikTok may have processed the data of children under the age of 13 without parental consent, and failed to provide proper information to its users in a “concise, transparent and easily understood way”. The ICO also said TikTok may have processed special category data – which includes ethnic and racial origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, trade union membership and genetic, biometric or health data – without legal grounds to do so.", "Watch CBS News  May 3, 2023 / 4:49 PM           / CBS/AP          U.S. regulators say Facebook misled parents and failed to protect the privacy of children using its Messenger Kids app, including misrepresenting the access to private user data that it provided to app developers.

This would include data collected through its virtual-reality products. The FTC said the company has failed to fully comply with the 2020 order.  Meta would also be subject to other limitations, including with its use of face-recognition technology and be required to provide additional privacy protections for its users. \"Facebook has repeatedly violated its privacy promises,\" said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The company's recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.\" Meta called the announcement a \"political stunt.\" \"Despite three years of continual engagement with the FTC around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,\" Meta said in a prepared statement."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

I met no frustrating moments of characters freezing or accidentally making the opposite move I intended; it feels incredibly smooth. A great example is an ability to cancel an attack to dodge another enemy's advance, so you never feel stuck when fighting.  That smoothness also extends to your utility belt, with the grappling hook becoming this lazy crimefighter’s best friend.

Nonetheless, when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation.[26] Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.[27]  For the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother.[28] In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian.[6] He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox.[29][n 8] In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.[32][n 9]  In 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to \"search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race\".[35] Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself.", "12] Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly;[13] thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.[14]  Between 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated.[15][n 3] His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: \"Schools and schoolmasters\", he later wrote, were \"prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.\"[16] In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier.[6] During this period, Shaw was known as \"George Shaw\"; after 1876, he dropped the \"George\" and styled himself \"Bernard Shaw\".[n 4]  In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned.

Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father;[6] there is no consensus among Shavian scholars on the likelihood of this.[7][8][9][10] The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother, but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply.[11] He found solace in the music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine mezzo-soprano voice and was much influenced by Lee's unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws' house was often filled with music, with frequent gatherings of singers and players.[2]  In 1862, Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an affluent part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay.", "By          Karen Zamora       ,          Ashley Brown       Bernard Shaw, the pioneering Black journalist who served as CNN's chief anchor for 20 years, died on Wednesday from pneumonia.

After the Queen’s death, Barlow said that while she could tell the Queen was unwell, she was “in quite good spirits.” On 7 September, the Queen was scheduled to attend an online meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom to swear in new ministers in Truss's government, but this was cancelled after she was advised by doctors to rest.[23] The Queen's final public statement, issued that same day, was a message of condolences for the victims of a mass stabbing incident in Saskatchewan, Canada.[24]  The Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96, ending her 70-year reign. According to her death certificate, which was made public on 29 September, she died of old age.[2] Her death was publicly announced at 18:30.", "At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle Lord Mountbatten. Their two children remained in Britain.[56]  As George VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she visited Canada and Harry S. Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[57] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya. On 6 February, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[58] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name,[59] and was therefore called Elizabeth II. The numeral offended some Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland.[60] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.", "In a striking moment just after the official announcement was made, the heavy rain battering London stopped and a large double rainbow appeared over the palace.

It's not a nice result\".[239]", "But there were periods of private and public pain.  In 1992, the Queen's \"annus horribilis\", fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children's marriages broke down. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly. There were questions about the monarchy's relevance in modern society.  \"No institution… should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't,\" she acknowledged. As a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service.  Reflecting on those words decades later, during her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she declared: \"Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.\" That same commitment to serving was made 45 years later in a thank you letter to the nation on the weekend of her Platinum Jubilee in June.

One million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[177] and the enthusiasm shown for Elizabeth by the public was greater than many journalists had anticipated.[178]  In 2003, Elizabeth sued the Daily Mirror for breach of confidence and obtained an injunction which prevented the outlet from publishing information gathered by a reporter who posed as a footman at Buckingham Palace.[179] The newspaper also paid £25,000 towards her legal costs.[180] Though generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Carlos Alcaraz saved a match point in the fourth set before digging deep in the decider to beat Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller and reach the U.S. Open semi-finals in the early hours of Thursday in New York. The Spanish teenager collapsed on his back after the match lasting more than five hours concluded at 2:50 a.m., beating the previous record for the latest finish of 2:26 a.m. set in three matches in 1993, 2012 and 2014. The 6-3 6-7(7) 6-7(0) 7-5 6-3 win keeps alive Alcaraz's hopes of winning a maiden Grand Slam title and claiming the world number one ranking. \"Honestly I still don't know how I did it,\" Alcaraz said in an on-court interview. \"The level that I played, the level of the match, the high quality of tennis. \"It's unbelievable.", "Sep 5, 2022 ...

The 19-year-old Spaniard and sentient highlight reel, whose sublime shotmaking and dogged hustle have seen him tabbed as the new face of the sport, came from behind and held on from ahead in a 6-7 (6), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-3 thriller to book a place in Sunday’s final opposite fifth-seeded Casper Ruud, who battled past Karen Khachanov in the day’s first semi-final. Up against an opponent brimming with confidence and the crackling Arthur Ashe Stadium atmosphere of nearly 24,000 spectators largely in the American’s corner, Alcaraz conjured his best tennis in one pressure moment after another with a poise and nerve beyond his years, ending the deepest run by an American man at the US Open since Andy Roddick reached the 2006 final and further building on his reputation as the best teenager in men’s tennis since Rafael Nadal nearly two decades ago.

Calvert took down a huge score on Dominic Thiem winning the 2019 Indian Wells title at 80-1, among many stunning calls.  In addition, Calvert nailed Casper Ruud making the 2022 French Open final, winning big for anyone who backed him. Sean also hit all three of his picks at plus-money odds in the Wimbledon final, including Novak Djokovic winning three sets to one at +275. Now, Calvert has locked in on the 2022 U.S. Open men's semifinal matchup featuring Tiafoe vs. Alcaraz and revealed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them. Alcaraz, the 19-year-old from Spain, is the betting favorite in the match, and he could become the No. 1 player in the world by the end of the week. This is his first grand slam semifinal, and he is the youngest player to reach the US Open semifinal since Pete Sampras in 1990.", "But in recent years, he has begun training much more often on hardcourts at the JC Ferrero Equelite Sport Academy in Villena, about 60 miles away, where Alcaraz boards and works with his coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, a former world No. 1 for whom the academy is named. Though Alcaraz beat Nadal and Djokovic to win the Masters 1000 title on clay in Madrid this year, and reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, his best results so far in his short career have come on hardcourts. He reached the quarterfinals last year in his debut U.S. Open and reached the semifinal of the BNP Paribas Open in March before winning the Miami Open. He has an all-action style, and he frequently slides into near splits even on a hardcourt, a surface that allows him to make fast changes in direction and get the full benefit of his quickness. Sinner, who defeated Alcaraz in July in the fourth round at Wimbledon, repeatedly had to hit three or four terrific shots close to the lines to secure points as Alcaraz stretched and skidded to retrieve balls that would have escaped the reach of lesser talents. Sinner is not as quick, not as much of a showman, but he has his own enviable strengths, including an ability to produce smooth, seemingly effortless power and precision by punching and counterpunching near or inside the baseline."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

We wish nothing but the best for Kyle and his entire family as he moves into the next chapter of his Hall of Fame career. We're thankful to have been along for the ride.'' Childress said the atmosphere at his shop in Welcome has been electric since rumors started that Busch might move to the organization. He also said when he looks in Busch's eyes, he sees the same fiery look of competition he once saw in the late Dale Earnhardt. Earnhardt won six of his seven Cup championships driving for Childress. But RCR has not won a title since Earnhardt's final championship in 1994. Reddick, a two-race winner this season, is currently 11th in the playoff standings. Austin Dillon, Childress' grandson, won the regular-season finale to snag the final playoff spot, is 14th in the standings as the Cup Series heads into Saturday night's elimination race at Bristol Motor Speedway. It was Dillon, Childress said, who encouraged his grandfather to speak to Busch after Reddick blindsided RCR with his plans to leave in 2024. Busch goes into Bristol ranked 13th in the standings.", "36  Editor’s Note: This story is included in The Athletic’s Best of 2022. View the full list.  Kyle Busch will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, multiple sources told The Athletic, ending a highly successful tenure at Joe Gibbs Racing that saw the driver-team pairing win two Cup Series championships and 56 races over a 15-year span. An official announcement is expected Tuesday. Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he’d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team’s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars’ eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement. That search complicated discussions with Busch regarding a contract extension as the team was uncertain what it could commit financially to re-signing Busch.", "Reddick will join 23XI in 2024. However, Busch has had a frosty relationship with RCR owner Richard Childress during his career. In 2011, Childress got into an altercation with Busch in the garage at Kansas Speedway that resulted in NASCAR fining Childress $150,000 and placing him on probation for the rest of the season. Asked at Kansas this past weekend how he could consider driving for Childress considering their history, Busch said: “The first time I sat down with him everything was OK and the biggest thing about it was just having the opportunity to put that behind us.” The inability of JGR to secure a primary sponsor and the lengthy negotiations leading to a new home for Busch in the Cup Series had taken a visible toll on the Las Vegas native in recent weeks. In an interview last month at Watkins Glen, Busch said whatever he decided “there’s a big change coming”. “Is it worth it to go run around and not have an opportunity to win right away versus building something versus jumping in something that can win? All those questions are certainly being weighed out,” he said then. “Again, that’s also why it’s not so simple and so easy. So, thankfully there are opportunities out there, here are Cup jobs available. But again, it will not look the same as what it has for the last 15 years.", "We put all of our differences behind us a while back and he’s a great race driver,” Childress said Aug. 28, after Dillon prevailed in the regular-season finale at Daytona. “He’ll land him a good ride somewhere, for sure.” RELATED: Kyle Busch through the years Busch joked about the long-ago fisticuffs last weekend at Kansas. “Who’s to say he hasn’t punched me again in any of these conversations?” Busch said to laughs. “Whenever you go into negotiations, it’s never fun so you’re duking the whole time. I think you grow up and you work through things, and you talk it over. Really, it was fine the first time I sat down with him. Everything was OK. The biggest thing about it was just having an opportunity to kind of put that behind us.” Kyle Busch qualified for the NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs with a victory earlier this year on the Bristol Motor Speedway dirt. That win in April extended his streak of seasons with at least one Cup Series victory to 18. Busch began his career as a Chevrolet prospect, joining the Cup Series full-time in 2005 with Hendrick Motorsports. He collected four wins with Rick Hendrick’s No. 5 team before his shift to Gibbs’ operation in 2008. Only Denny Hamlin, driver of JGR’s No.", "That aspiration, he said, was clouded by the organization’s search for a top-tier sponsor to replace longtime partner M&M’s/Mars. Busch indicated on Sept. 1 at Cup Series Playoffs Media Day he had multiple offers to consider, and that the negotiation process had weighed on him. “Trust me, my gut doesn’t feel good, and that’s not just for decisions being made, but more so of decisions being weighed and the perception in how you come across to all of those that you’re going to disappoint, right?” Busch said at Media Day. “There’s going to be one winner, and the rest are not winners, if you look at it in that regard.” MORE: Biggest NASCAR free agent signings David Wilson, Toyota Racing Development president, had stressed the importance of keeping Busch in the automaker’s fold as discussions were ongoing, saying that “any other scenario is just unacceptable.” Busch ranks as Toyota’s top winner in all three NASCAR national series with 203 of his 224 total victories achieved during his time with the manufacturer. “I mean, Kyle Busch is our 60-home run hitter,” Wilson said Aug. 27 at Daytona International Speedway. “And we’d be foolish not to put everything in play to keep him in the family.” Joe Gibbs Racing and Toyota are now absorbing the loss of Busch’s looming departure from the heart of their batting order, and both groups will work to fill the vacancy."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Calculating Annual Inflation Rates Annual rates of inflation are calculated using 12-month selections of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which is published monthly by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To calculate the inflation rate for a specific month, such as January 2017, subtract the CPI for that month of the previous year (in this case, January 2016) from the current CPI (January 2017). The result is the difference between the two CPIs. Divide this number by the CPI for the previous year, then multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign to obtain the inflation rate for the given month. For example, to calculate the inflation rate for January 2017, subtract the January 2016 CPI of 236.916 from the January 2017 CPI of 242.839, which yields 5.923. Divide 5.923 by 236.916, multiply by 100, and add a % sign to obtain an inflation rate of 2.5% for January 2017.

With the assistance of the Light Dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the Demon Dragon's secret stone, killing it. Aided by the spirits of Rauru and Sonia, Link turns the Light Dragon back into Zelda and regains his original right arm. Rauru and Sonia fade away, and Link and Zelda fall to the surface below, where they reunite.  Some time later, on the Great Sky Island, Mineru bids goodbye to Zelda and Link before fading away, while the sages vow to protect Hyrule.

The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.", "Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty Images                                       hide caption                   A Pearly King and Queen line the Procession Route in London.

She received the mandate to form a government from Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella on Friday afternoon after two days of official consultations, and is set to be sworn in at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday.           Last month’s general election resulted in an alliance of far-right and center-right parties, led by her ultraconservative Brothers of Italy, winning enough seats in Italy’s parliament to form a government.           Meloni announced her government picks in Rome’s Quirinal Palace, making the leader of Italy’s far right League party, Matteo Salvini, infrastructure minister.            Giancarlo Giorgetti, also of the League party, was made economy minister. Antonio Tajani from the Forza Italia party was given the position of minister of foreign affairs while the role of defense minister went to Guido Crosetto, one of the founders of the Brothers of Italy party.           The new government will be made up of a coalition of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, Salvini’s League party and the Forza Italia party, led by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The Brothers of Italy received nine ministries whereas Forza Italia and the League each received five ministries.", "Heading into the 2022 Italian general election, a snap election that was called after the 2022 Italian government crisis,[78][79] it was agreed among the centre-right coalition that the leader of the party receiving the most votes would be put forward as the prime minister candidate.[80] As of July 2022, FdI was the first party in the coalition according to opinion polling,[81][82] and she was widely expected to become Prime Minister of Italy if the centre-right coalition obtained an absolute majority in Parliament, which would be the most right-wing government in the history of the Italian Republic according to some academics.[83] In an attempt to moderate herself to placate fears among those who describe FdI as neo-fascist or far right,[84] including fears within the European Commission that she could lead Italy towards Hungary under Viktor Orbán,[85] Meloni told the foreign press that Italian fascism is history. As president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party since 2020,[86] she said she shared the experiences and values of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, Likud in Israel, and the Republican Party in the United States.[87] Critics were sceptical of her claims, citing her speeches on immigration and LGBT rights.[88][89] She campaigned for lower taxes, less European bureaucracy, and a halt to immigration through a naval blockade,[90][91] saying she would put national interests first.[92][93][94]", "30] She was the second youngest-ever minister in the history of united Italy.[31] In August 2008, she invited Italian athletes to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in disagreement with the Chinese policy implemented towards Tibet; this statement was criticised by Berlusconi, as well as the foreign affairs minister Franco Frattini.[32] In 2009, her party merged with Forza Italia (FI) into The People of Freedom (PdL) and she took over the presidency of the united party's youth section, called Young Italy.[31] In the same year, she voted in favour of a decree law against euthanasia.[33]  In November 2010, on behalf of the ministry, she presented a 300 million euro package called the Right to the Future. It was aimed at investing in young people and contained five initiatives, including incentives for new entrepreneurs, bonuses in favour of temporary workers and loans for deserving students.[34] In November 2012, she announced her bid to contest the PdL leadership against Angelino Alfano, in opposition to the party's support of the Monti government. After the cancellation of the primaries, she teamed up with fellow politicians Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto to set out an anti-Monti policy, asking for renewal within the party and being also critical of the leadership of Berlusconi.[35][36]", "The possibility of Meloni becoming the first woman to become Prime Minister of Italy had been widely discussed both prior to and after the 2022 Italian general election. Some women did not see this as a victory due to her political positions, while others saw it at least partly in a positive light, and a few others called her a feminist despite Meloni's rejection of the label.[241] Prior to the election, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented: \"The election of the first woman prime minister in a country always represents a break with the past, and that is certainly a good thing.\"[242][243] This prompted a response from some critics and observers, including historians Ruth Ben-Ghiat and David Broder. Ben-Ghiat wrote: \"Meloni would also represent continuity with Italy's darkest episode.\"[244] For her part, Meloni declared herself ready to govern and criticised feminists.[245]  Meloni has criticised Italy's approach towards illegal immigrants,[246] calling for a zero-tolerance policy, and she wants to blockade migrants from reaching Italian ports,[91] and boost the birth rate of Italian nationals to ease the need for migrant labour.[247] She is opposed to birthright citizenship proposals, which would give citizenship including education rights to immigrants born and living in Italy.[248] She has linked illegal immigration and crime, and refugee arrivals to human trafficking and prostitution.", "Italy has had all sorts of leaders — including Silvio Berlusconi, with his politics-as-theater approach to governing (and who six years ago discouraged a pregnant Meloni from running for mayor of Rome, saying a “mother cannot be mayor”). Meloni is hardly the first to relish political combat. But some Italians worry she’ll further polarize the country and loosen some of the restraints in society. Edith Bruck, a Holocaust survivor and poet who lives in Rome, and who has befriended Pope Francis, noted Meloni’s shorthand way for introducing herself: as a woman, a mother, an Italian and a Christian. “What is the implication of that?” Bruck said. “That she isn’t Muslim or Jewish? It all goes back to the idea that Europe is Christian and non-Christians are a threat.” Meloni’s allies see it differently. Giovanbattista Fazzolari, a Brothers of Italy senator who has known Meloni since she was a teenager, said Meloni would represent the whole country, but that there could be “exceedingly hard” clashes with entrenched powers that she judges aren’t working “for the good of the nation.” On the campaign trail, Meloni has dealt with mostly adoring crowds, plus the occasional protest group chanting “fascists” at her supporters.

For England’s Gareth Southgate and other international managers, this two-week window offers a crucial chance to fine-tune World Cup squads. There are only two months until the first game in Qatar but this break also offers young players, such as Arsenal’s Portuguese midfielder Fabio Vieira and Chelsea’s French defender Wesley Fofana, the chance to impress in their country’s youth sides. Advertisement As some players head off around the world, others will remain at their clubs during a break that may have significant repercussions on the rest of the league season. The Athletic takes a look at who has been called up to senior international squads from all 20 Premier League teams. Several of Arsenal’s international hopefuls missed out on call-ups. The Brazilian “Gabriel” trio of Martinelli, Jesus and Magalhaes have not been included in Tite’s Brazil squad, which is otherwise littered with Premier League names.

A 71st cap, 10 years an international, his positional play has come on leaps and bounds under Antonio Conte at Tottenham. Another who has not played a lot of football recently, had an anxious moment when his attempts to play out from the back were shut down early on. Nearly punished for not dropping quick enough when Hennessey kept out Tsygankov with his feet, but the Spurs defender was purposeful in possession. Played Yaremchuk onside for an early chance and was grateful to Hennessey. Made a vital headed clearance from under his own crossbar. Indeed, it was as if Ampadu's head was a magnet to the ball. Wales warmed to their task from the moment Williams cut inside and fizzed a sighter wide. Switched off at the far post to nearly let Karavaev in but combined well with Daniel James going forward.

It was credited as a Yarmolenko own goal, but who cares? For many, the greatest player that Wales has ever produced. Came close to a second but was denied by Bushchan. This was far from his best game but it was entirely fitting that he would be heavily involved in the goal which ended 64 years of hurt.

During World War II, Shintaro volunteered to be a kamikaze pilot but the war ended before he completed training.[4]  Abe's maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was the de facto \"economic king\" of occupied China and Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state in Northern China established after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II.[5][6] During the war, Kishi served as Vice Minister of Munitions in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo.[7] At the end of the war, Kishi was imprisoned as a suspected \"Class-A\" war criminal by the US military occupation of Japan, but was released and later de-purged as part of the Occupation's \"reverse course\" due to the Cold War.", "Despite no longer being Japan's premier, Abe remained influential on national security and economic policies and was a central figure within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

He was then elected president of the LDP before becoming Japan's prime minister in 2006 at the age of 52 -- the country's youngest premier since World War II. Abe served as the Japanese prime minister from 2006 to 2007 and then again from 2012 to 2020, before stepping down due to chronic health issues. He later revealed he was being treated for ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal disease. Some of Abe's actions and policies, including his visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine to honor World War II criminals and laws that were passed during his time in office allowing the Japan Self-Defense Forces to participate in wars alongside allies overseas, had strained relationships with neighboring nations. He was also a strong vocal critic of China, as he sided with Taiwan's desire to be recognized as a democratic, independent state.

Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in front of Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc.

This wording change satisfies the original intention of the gradual scale points system when it was introduced in 2022.[17]  The deployment and position of the recovery vehicle on the track was criticised after AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly narrowly missed the vehicle due to poor visibility, angrily remonstrated that \"[he] could have killed [himself]\" if he had lost control and hit the vehicle, even at reduced speed.[18] Gasly also attacked the deployment as \"disrespectful\" to the memory and family of his childhood friend Jules Bianchi, who suffered fatal injuries at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix when he crashed into a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit.

The original series starred Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a physicist who created a time machine that allowed the user to travel through time within their own lifetime. After finding himself adrift in the Quantum Leap machine with no way home, Dr. Beckett resolved to put things right that once went wrong… hoping that his next leap would be the leap home. Quantum Leap joins several other series to be given a second chance, though it seems that for every terrific and twisted Twin Peaks-level continuation, there's a disappointing Heroes Reborn.

However, actual selling prices can vary, and you may find it for prices up to around $2000 for higher-end AIB models.", "docs": ["Comparing the RTX 4090 to the RTX 4080 reveals a flaw in Nvidia’s pricing plan for this generation — the numbers just don’t add up. If you look at the RTX 4080 alone, regardless of the price, it is a really good graphics card. It outperforms every GPU from the previous generation, including the RTX 3090 Ti, by a considerable amount. The sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what gamers truly think. It’s also around 30% slower than the RTX 4090 while only being 25% cheaper, and this is where things get complicated, because, at MSRP, the RTX 4090 is a much better deal than the 4080 — even if it’s more expensive. It offers much better performance per dollar, which historically hasn’t been the case. The flagships were aimed at enthusiasts who didn’t try to get the best deal; they just wanted the best performance. Take one step down from the top and the good deals start, where the performance is still great but the price is less ridiculous. That hasn’t been true in this generation, and the sales of the RTX 4080 are showing us what Nvidia’s customers think about this. Every time a new GPU drops, scalpers can be counted on to buy it en masse and then throw it up on eBay at a huge markup.", "The RTX 4090 is available at most major retailers in the US, but you shouldn’t expect a cheap price anywhere, as no matter what card you choose, you’ll be paying at least $1599. On the higher-end of the AIB cards, especially the ASUS ROG Strix OC’d model, you could pay up to around $2000 in total. Though, some of these premium cards can now be found at a slight discount, if you are lucky.  If you’re looking for an RTX 4090 prebuilt PC, retailer B&H has already equipped itself with all manner of configurations for you to purchase. However, expect to spend around $4000 on a brand-new PC of this caliber, as the rest of the parts will also be fairly high-end.  The RTX 4090 is priced at an MSRP of $1599. However, in current listings, you should expect this number to vary from $1599, all the way to around $2000 for the higher-end AIB models from brands such as ASUS. However, months after launch, prices for board partner GPUs are beginning to ease toward MSRP. Despite this, it’s still priced lower than we initially expected, as a Vietnamese retailer listed the new GPU for over $2000. However, it’s thankfully lower.", "Now, we’re seeing some SKUs, such as premium cooling models get slight discounts, presumably in an effort to get the pricey GPU off of the shelves.  The RTX 4090 will not be the fastest Lovelace-based GPU that Nvidia will release, it is going to use a cut-down version of the AD102, the best chip. Nvidia will also be saving the full-fat version later down the line. The reason why companies usually start on the highest-end of cards is that they are able to then do something named “chip binning”. So, if a chip is made and doesn’t quite cut the mustard to become 4090, then it might be put into a pile for use later in life as an RTX 4080 Ti later down the line. We’ve also seen rumors of an RTX 4090 Ti begin to circulate. But, those are just rumors for now. You certainly will not be disappointed if you pick one up and your CPU is more than up to the task of keeping up with a behemoth of a GPU such as this.  It’s important to note that we are talking about the desktop-class RTX 4090. For laptops, the RTX 4090 is actually similar in performance to an RTX 4070 Ti, though it comes slightly shy of being as powerful as the desktop-class GPU.", "In short — the RTX 4080 seems to have done the 4090 a favor. It made an overpriced GPU suddenly appear much more desirable than it ever should have been. Now, the question is, was this Nvidia’s plan all along, or did it simply overestimate the enthusiasm people would have for the 4080? Considering the fact that Nvidia is planning to strategically cut the MSRP of the RTX 4080 soon, it might be that it never intended for the 4080 to serve as a crutch for the sales of the 4090. Nvidia also has some serious competition on the horizon. AMD will soon be launching the next-gen Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT, both of which are supposed to rival the RTX 4080, but at more reasonable prices — $999 and $899, respectively. With the upcoming price cut, the RTX 4080 might become a more worthwhile contender. For now, if you manage to spot the 4090 for $1,600, it is a better deal — but only if you can make use of it. If you’re a casual gamer, save your money and get the 4080 without worrying about benchmarks and comparisons. Personally, I’m still waiting for the 7900 XTX, and judging by the performance per dollar of the RTX 4080, I really have no regrets.", "Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.

It goes against the design language of the Apple Watch, which historically has been a squircle and likely will remain that way for a while. On the other hand, the Pixel Watch is round like many other Wear OS smartwatches, but it’s by far the most beautiful of the bunch.           The size it comes in feels like a good middle ground. It’s not too small where it looks weird on larger wrists, yet it’s not too big to hang off of smaller wrists. It’s a tad bigger than the 41mm Apple Watch, which feels right for a watch that comes in a single size.           There’s a crown on the right side that can be rotated to sift through the user interface, and a button sits above it to give you quick access to recent apps. You can double-press either of them to pull up Google Wallet in a pinch. It all works just as you’d expect.           The band situation is pretty interesting."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Monaco, whose public sector career spans both government and non-profit organizations, brings extensive knowledge of park equity and community development to the position, as well as strong leadership in driving sustainable impact for civic organizations. Monaco is the first Black leader of the Alliance, further diversifying executive leadership within the open space sector, and continues the legacy of female leadership at the Alliance over the course of its 35-year history. Monaco succeeds former Prospect Park Alliance President Sue Donoghue, who was appointed New York City Parks Commissioner earlier this year. Monaco looks forward to working with the board, staff and most especially park users to help shape her vision for the park’s future. Coming out of the pandemic and recognizing the ways in which the park has been an invaluable resource for New Yorkers to recover, she looks forward to strengthening the organization’s capacity in order to keep pace with the needs of the park community and the robust use of the park. She plans to leverage her experience in working on citywide equity initiatives and serving vulnerable communities to explore the ways in which the Alliance can bring more social services to the park.", "There’s so much that goes on “behind the scenes” that may not be apparent to the average park visitor, and I’m excited to learn in-depth how the park operates throughout the year. I am also particularly excited about joining the team at this moment in time. There has never been more interest in and use of the park, and I’m excited to talk to our community about why Prospect Park is special for them, and how the park has taken on new meaning during the pandemic. With a background in environmental sustainability and social justice, how do you think Prospect Park can be a both thought and action leader in these areas?   I think it’s important to start from a place of seeing sustainability and social justice as symbiotic. Sustainability is not just a luxury that gets added on top, but is deeply integrated into the work we do as a society to promote equity and social justice. I see access to open space as one of the core pillars, among others such as education, housing, health and safety, that help transition people from surviving to thriving. Over the past two years in particular, we’ve seen how important the park has been for our  health and wellbeing. I want to work with our talented team, as well as our community, to continue to lean into that and think about more opportunities for New Yorkers to access health services in the park.", "Today, Prospect Park is an international model for the care of urban parks, and one of the premier green spaces in the United States. Over the past decade, Prospect Park Alliance has expanded its operating budget to more than $13 million each year for the care of the park, and increased its endowment to $25 million. In addition, the Alliance has secured more than $130 million in public funding for capital improvements, including the restoration of the Vale in the park’s northeast corner, the largest single capital allocation in the history of the Alliance. Other current and recent projects include the award-winning restorations of the Endale Arch and Concert Grove Pavilion, and the restoration of the Flatbush Avenue perimeter and the creation of two new entrances to the park along Flatbush, the first new entrances to the park since the 1940s. During the pandemic, when the park saw record visitorship and a drop in public funding, the Alliance was able to rally its community of volunteers and supporters for record volunteer and fundraising success, which resulted in Re:New Prospect Park, an ongoing initiative to sustain the park to address high use during the pandemic via maintenance and capital improvements.

The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet and selects its ministers. As modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, they sit as members of Parliament.  The office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[3] In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons.  The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service and the minister responsible for national security.[4]: p.22  In 2019, the office of minister for the Union was established; Boris Johnson became the first prime minister to hold this title.[5] The prime minister's official residence and office is 10 Downing Street in London.[6]  Rishi Sunak has been the prime minister since 25 October 2022.[7]  The position of prime minister was not created; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective.", "citation needed] The prime minister's authority was further enhanced by the Parliament Act 1911, which marginalised the influence of the House of Lords in the law-making process.[citation needed]  The prime minister is the head of the United Kingdom government.[9] As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation.[10]  In the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of His Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.[11]  Charles III    William, Prince of Wales    Charles III(King-in-Council)", "Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party.

Netflix Standard with Ads subscribers will have to sit through 4-5 minutes of commercials per hour, with the ads running at the beginning and during videos. Each ad will be either 15 or 30 seconds. That 4-5 minute per hour figure is pretty much in line with Netflix’s competitors. For example, the “with ads” version of HBO Max averages about four minutes an hour, while Peacock tops out at about five minutes per hour.  It’s also worth noting that Netflix isn’t putting ads in children’s programming or in “new” Netflix Originals movies. Nope, not everything. Netflix licenses many of its movies and TV shows from third parties, including some Netflix Originals, and those agreements will need to be renegotiated before Netflix can insert ads into those videos for streaming.  According to Netflix chief operating officer Greg Peters, anywhere between 5 and 10 percent of programming on Netflix’s ad-free tiers will be unavailable for “with ads” users, although Peters says the streamer will “work to reduce that number over time.", "While only a small percentage of titles weren’t available on Netflix with ads at launch, some of those titles are big ones, including (according to Variety) Arrested Development, Breaking Bad, Gray’s Anatomy, The Crown, Cobra Kai, House of Cards, Peaky Blinders, New Girl, The Good Place, and Friday Night Lights. Among the missing movies are Skyfall, 28 Days, The Imitation Game, and The Bad Guys. That’s starting to change, however. As of March 2023, The Crown was available for streaming on Netflix with ads, among other previously unavailable titles. If you do run across a video that’s unavailable on the Netflix Standard with Ads plan, you’ll see a padlock on the title, or a “Change plan to watch” banner in place of the standard “Play” button. One of the best perks offered by the big streamers is the ability to download their videos for offline viewing, perfect for binge-watching your favorite series during a long flight or when you don’t want to bust through your data cap. Unfortunately–but not surprisingly–Netflix won’t let Standard with Ads subscribers download videos for offline viewing. Indeed, the practice of streamers barring with-ads users from downloading videos is pretty much the norm, and that includes Paramount+, which is otherwise fairly liberal with its ad-supported features.  Besides the U.S.", "Netflix with ads launched on November 3 in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, German, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Given that Netflix is available in more than 190 countries, we’d expect Netflix Standard with Ads to debut in many more territories in the months ahead. Netflix lost subscribers during the first and second quarters of 2022, ending a decade of growth and sending Netflix’s stock price into a tailspin. And while Netflix is ubiquitous in North America, it’s having trouble gaining traction in the rest of the world, where it’s facing tough competition from cheaper streaming services. Meanwhile, Netflix’s rapidly growing competitors, including HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock, and Hulu, all have–or are preparing to roll out–their own cheaper ad-supported plans, all of which currently undercut Netflix’s cheapest ad-free plans. So while it wasn’t all that long ago that Netflix executives scoffed at the idea of cheaper ad-supported plans, the company abruptly changed course once it became clear that its once seemingly unstoppable growth had stalled.

By Radhika Seth and Kerry McDermott The next installment of Netflix’s big-budget, awards-laden original series is expected to cover the early to mid-1990s, a period in which the marriage of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, was rapidly disintegrating. Yes. On October 20, Netflix released the first official trailer for The Crown Season 5—and it’s a scorcher. It opens with a shot of Windsor Castle in flames (a fire ravaged the royal residence during the Queen’s annus horribilis in 1992) and then shows Imelda Staunton as the monarch, examining its ashen remains. “In light of the events of the last 12 months, perhaps I have more to reflect on than most,” she muses in voiceover. Also featured? Elizabeth Debicki’s Princess Diana and Dominic West’s Prince Charles looking stony-faced during a meeting with the Queen; the latter confronting her son about his ongoing affair with Olivia Williams’s Camilla Parker Bowles; Diana seemingly reaching breaking point and taking off her famous sapphire and diamond engagement ring; and later donning her famous “revenge dress.", "\"As we started to discuss the storylines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,\" Peter Morgan said in a statement.   And with Season 6 slated to bring the story into the early 2000s, per Variety, that means Season 5 could cover the late '90s; but that's yet to be confirmed.    The Crown was meant to last for six seasons from the start. After the show first debuted, Netflix's head of content, Ted Sarandos, said in 2016, \"The idea is to do this over six decades, in six seasons presumably, and make the whole show over eight to 10 years.\" Sarandos's plan seemed to be further solidified in October 2019, when show creator Peter Morgan signed a massive overall deal with Netflix. Sources had told Deadline that the agreement would include two more seasons of The Crown following Season 4. After all the back and forth, we're back to Plan A.  Just as the cast was updated after the first two seasons, the show is doing the same by the time it arrives to Season 5.

To date, each installment of The Crown has spanned approximately a decade. The fifth season was initially expected to be the show’s final installment and take the royals from the early ’90s into the 2000s, however showrunner Peter Morgan later changed his mind, deciding instead to split the events of the decade into two seasons. “As we started to discuss the storylines for series five, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan said. With that in mind, Season 5 is likely to begin in the early ’90s and end somewhere in the middle of that decade. By Hannah Coates By Alexandra Macon By Hannah Jackson The first half of the ’90s was particularly tumultuous for the Queen, with plenty of incidents that are ripe for dramatization.

The incumbent president’s ability to launch new major policy initiatives would be greatly weakened under divided government.

Using the data we discuss below (and provide here) we would expect Democratic seat losses of around 30 in the House and 3 in the Senate. There are large error bounds around these estimates. The prediction range includes the possibility of a narrow Democratic gain in the Senate, but loss of the majority in the House seems likely. Graphs below show the two-variable relationships. Democrats have a 9 seat margin currently in the House (with four seats vacant) and the parties are tied in the Senate. A Democratic loss in the House of fewer than 12 seats would be very unexpected.

Compared to speech development, however, much less is known about how infants process songs or how songs affect their development. Lyrics and melody are two key components of songs, and much of the research on song processing has examined how the two components of the songs are processed. The current study focused on the roles of lyrics and melody in song perception, by examining developmental patterns and the ways in which lyrics and melody are processed in the infants' brains using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The results revealed that developmental changes occur in infants' processing of lyrics and melody in a similar timeline as perceptual reorganization, that is, from 4.5 and 12 months of age. We found that 4.5-month-olds showed a right hemispheric advantage in the processing of songs that underwent a change in either lyrics or melodies. Conversely, 12-month-olds showed significantly higher activation bilaterally when lyrics and melody changed at the same time. These results suggest that 4.5-month-olds processed songs in the same manner as music without lyrics. Moreover, 12-month-olds processed lyrics and melody in an interactive manner, a sign of a more mature processing method.", "ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03232931.

ID singing tends to have more restricted pitch ranges, stable pitch relations (i.e., intervals), and more regular beats (Trainor, 1996).", "Krystin Ver Linden’s Sundance 2022 pic Alice, starring Keke Palmer, Common, Gaius Charles and Jonny Lee Miller; and John Michael McDonagh’s The Forgiven, starring Ralph Fiennes, Jessica Chastain and Matt Smith, which premiered at Tribeca 2022.  \t           \tJarowey negotiated the deal for Lullaby on behalf of Vertical, with Scott Parish on behalf of Alcon.

{"id": 204, "query": "Who is the Doctor's new companion in Doctor Who?", "ans": ["Millie Gibson"], "label": [-1], "prediction": "I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents. The document provides information about the concept of a companion in the show Doctor Who, mentions past companions, and talks about auditions for a new companion, but it does not specify who the new companion is as of the latest available information in the document provided.", "docs": ["Although the term \"companion\" is designated to specific characters by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.[4] For instance, Stephen Brook in The Guardian newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that \"what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear\".[4] During the Doctor's latest incarnations, his primary companions, such as Rose Tyler and Martha Jones, have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the \"first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\"[5]  despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous series—including several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.  The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is Billie Piper, although short-term companions Bruno Langley (Adam Mitchell), John Barrowman (Jack Harkness) and Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) all appear.", "In the third series, Barrowman receives a title credit for his return to the show alongside permanent cast member Freema Agyeman, and in series four Agyeman is restored to the opening titles for her return arc as Martha Jones. Series four also gives Agyeman, Piper, Barrowman, and Elisabeth Sladen title billing for their reappearances in the final two-parter. Clarke also reprises his role in the series four finale; although listed as a companion alongside the other actors on the BBC Doctor Who website,[6] Clarke is not credited in this way. In \"The End of Time\", John Simm receives title billing for his antagonist role as the Master, ahead of Bernard Cribbins as companion Wilfred Mott. In subsequent years, Claire Skinner, Nick Frost and Mark Gatiss have received title credits in special episodes for roles that are not considered companions, as does Piper for her non-companion return in \"The Day of the Doctor\".  Companions in the new series also have a more flexible tenure than their classical predecessors. Several companion characters have returned to the series after leaving the Doctor's company, most notably in the Series Four finale \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" (2008), which features a record eight past, present and future companions: Donna is joined by a returning Rose, Martha, Jack, Sarah Jane, and Mickey, while past companion K9 and future companion Wilfred Mott make appearances.", "In the long-running BBC television science fiction programme Doctor Who and related works, the term \"companion\" refers to a character who travels or shares adventures with the Doctor. In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often furthers the story by asking questions (often to help the audience understand too) and getting into trouble; also by helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as their \"friends\" or \"assistants\"; the British press have also used the latter term.  In the earliest episodes of Doctor Who, the dramatic structure of the programme's cast was rather different from the hero-and-sidekick pattern that emerged later. Initially, the character of the Doctor was unclear, with uncertain motives and abilities.[1]  The protagonists were schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who provided the audience's point of view in stories set in Earth's history and on alien worlds. Ian in particular served the role of the action hero. The fourth character was the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, who (though initially presented as an \"unearthly child\") was intended[citation needed] as an identification figure for younger viewers.", "The 13th Doctor referred to this full TARDIS as her “fam,” and in the big finale episode – “The Power of the Doctor” — several companions from previous eras joined the adventure, too. But the future of Who is looking a bit simpler. In fact, with the casting of Gibson, it almost seems like Doctor Who 2024 will be a soft reboot. Although the number of regular companions in the TARDIS has varied over the nearly 60-year-long history of Doctor Who (and the show began with three companions on the TARDIS) contemporary fans tend to think of the series as a series that stars two people; the Doctor, and the companion. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper kicked off the new era of Who in 2005, which was followed by David Tennant and Billie Piper in 2006. Following that it was Tennant and Freema Agyeman for Season 3, Tennant and Catherine Tate for Season 4, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan for Season 5, Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman for Season 7, Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman for Seasons 8 and 9, and then Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Season 10. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan filming Doctor Who Season 7 in New York City in April 2012.", "Russell T Davies, Doctor Who showrunner, said: \"It’s the great honour of my job to find the next generation of talent, and Millie shines like a star already. She’s brilliant, dynamic, clever and a wonderful actor. As a Coronation Street fan, I’ve seen Millie survive chases, guns and sieges, but that’s nothing compared to what lies ahead for Ruby Sunday.\" Sign up for the latest Who news, reviews, interviews and features By entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Biden's sister Finnegan James Biden stood by her side as the maid of honor, and her other sister Roberta Mabel Biden and Katherine Elizabeth Neal served as her bridesmaids. During the ceremony, the duo traded personalized vows that they wrote themselves. To keep warm in the brisk weather, the 250 guests wrapped themselves in blankets, CNN reports. Once the ceremony ended at 11:50 a.m., the wedding party celebrated at a luncheon. The rest of the guests returned later in the evening for a reception, filled with dancing and dessert.   Esteemed event planner Bryan Rafanelli of Rafanelli Events helped orchestrate the couple’s dream day, which included a green and white color palette. One standout decoration was a cascade of white flowers and greenery that adorned the Truman balcony. “I am honored to have had the opportunity to bring Peter and Naomi’s vision for their wedding day to life and to work in this historic house once again,” Rafanelli wrote on Instagram. “As with every private celebration, we have worked closely with the couple and their families to create a beautiful and elegant celebration reflecting their story while highlighting the rich history of the White House.", "Nov 22, 2022 ...

Designing for different generations was nothing new for O’Neill, a Colorado native who was taught to sew at a young age by her grandmother, who lived with her family and nurtured her interest in design. “I’ve always had her in my life. I would make all of her clothing for her, actually. I would make all of her pieces for my brother and sister’s weddings, or for any events that we had to go to, and some daytime looks for her. I would make her coats and everything,” O’Neill explains. That work honed her ability to dress all ages. Several weeks ago, she lost her grandmother, who was 95. O’Neill is reflective about the way things have unfolded for her, and effusive about her appreciation of the first family’s sustained loyalty to her work. “[The Bidens] have always been very supportive and kind and thoughtful; so easy to work with, which I think is really rare with a lot of clients.

France have considerably less structure in possession. Their best attacking moments come following spontaneous, intricate passing combinations between the forward trio — Mbappe, Griezmann and Benzema. France’s second goal against Switzerland at Euro 2020 is a perfect example of this. Advertisement Benzema is positioned on the outside shoulder of the Switzerland left-back Ricardo Rodriguez. Kingsley Coman plays into Griezmann’s feet (white arrow) and he combines with Mbappe (blue then gold arrow) to get into the six-yard box…  … Griezmann’s shot hits goalkeeper Yann Sommer and loops to Benzema at the back post.  This was one of three France goals in quick succession and they have a habit of second-half goalscoring flurries.

After posting two wins in his first season, Temple posted a 6-6 record in 2014, setting the stage for the best back-to-back seasons in school history. Temple posted a 10-4 record in 2015, were ranked as high as No. 22 in the Associated Press Poll and reached the American Athletic Conference's inaugural championship game. In 2016, Rhule led the Owls to a 10-3 record and an AAC championship. The conference title was the first in 49 seasons for the Temple program, and the Owls reached bowl games in consecutive seasons for the first time in school history. His success at Temple led Rhule to be named Baylor's head coach beginning with the 2017 season.  After one win in his first season, the Bears posted a 7-6 record a made a trip to the Texas Bowl in Rhule's second year. In his final season in Waco in 2019, Rhule guided Baylor to an 11-3 record, an appearance in the Big 12 championship game and a Sugar Bowl berth.", "“We'll just get really process-oriented, detail-oriented and ultimately, when you start doing those fundamental championship habit-type things, as I think about them, those types of wins and things follow.” The Huskers haven’t won a conference title this century, the last one in 1999.

Matt is detail-oriented, his teams are disciplined and play a physical brand of football. Matt also has the personality and relationship-building skills to build a great staff and excel in recruiting.” Conversations between Alberts and Rhule intensified this month, with transfer portal activity restarting in early December. The early signing period opens two weeks later. Rhule resurrected programs at Temple and Baylor from 2013 to 2019, winning 10 games or more in three of his seven seasons, and he was seen as a home-run hire by outsiders. He’s from New York and coached on the East Coast aside from one season at UCLA as an assistant and his tenure at Baylor, but he’s familiar with the Big Ten as a former Penn State linebacker. Rhule also thrived in an unfamiliar environment in Texas, helping the Bears rebuild after a sexual assault scandal threatened to destroy the program. Advertisement His Panthers contract also increased his level of attractiveness to Alberts. Rhule signed a seven-year, $62 million deal in 2020 and is owed more than $40 million through the end of the deal. Any salary paid to Rhule by his next employer is subtracted from the amount owed by the Panthers, so the program could get a relative bargain in Rhule — for the first four seasons of his deal."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Speaking to Empire, Mackey mentioned a sleepover amongst the Barbie cast that has fans talking. “Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies, which would involve playing games with Scott [Evans] and Ncuti [Gatwa],” she said.  She later added, \"Barbie is light and funny and silly and American and pink.\" Rest assured, it won't make you cry. \"It’s very unexpected in many ways,\" Mackey said.

Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'

That performance was widely expected to herald a new age of achievement. It also seemed to justify Pele’s assertion that an African team would win the World Cup by 2000. However, that prediction would ultimately fall short. But in 2002, Senegal staked claims for the big prize.

Emmert himself entered the role with ambition and big ideas, only to end up spending the majority of his final years taking bullets for college presidents and flubbing seemingly every public appearance. Finding the next NCAA president will not be easy. One athletic director told ESPN: \"The big question is, 'Who would really want that job?' My question is, 'Do they bring someone in for 2-3 years that's trusted to get everyone through the choppy waters? Or do they go long term?'\" A short-term option could be someone like former Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby or former NCAA executive Oliver Luck.

Even if an NCAA president wouldn't exactly welcome such changes, having someone who could work in tandem with conference commissioners, school presidents and athletes to provide structure to those shifts would go a long way toward turning this organization from a dinosaur into an active participant in the evolution of college sports. Voepel: While not being naive about the fact that college sports are big business, I hope the next president is much more in touch with actual student-athletes and what they want and need. Student-athletes are more powerful than ever because of NIL opportunities and the transfer portal. But they also seem more troubled than ever by stress/mental health concerns. And if some of the tragedies we have seen in recent years in that regard don't seriously alarm the NCAA, they should. On top of everything else the new president has to navigate, concern for and communication with student-athletes needs to be a bigger priority."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The danger, Muniz said, revolved primarily around potentially attracting “nefarious characters” in and around the crypto industry.  “In the crypto community, there are these things called crypto whales. It’s people who have made a lot of money in crypto. And it’s attracted some nefarious characters and it has put people in severe jeopardy,” added Muniz during her D3 interview.  She also said there is a “misconception” that these founders are crypto whales.  Earlier this month, Buzzfeed published an investigation revealing Wylie Aranow and Greg Solano as two of the four Bored Ape founders.  The investigation did not reveal anything negative about the two individuals, earning Buzzfeed a trouncing on Twitter from the crypto community.  “Doxxing people for clicks and ad revenue.", "What Yuga Labs wants to build after raising $450M", "And details are still thin for how the world will look, and how the company will measure success.

Yuga Labs is likely still sitting on a heap of capital from its whopping $450 million seed round it raised in March 2022, led by Andreessen Horowitz.

Additionally, Alegre’s experience in driving global partnerships across all functional areas will likely be beneficial as Yuga Labs looks to integrate with other Web3 projects and the metaverse.

Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “The movie is set up for a very strong run through the holidays.”  \tAs the sequel to the highest-grossing movie in history, Hollywood has some pretty high expectations for “The Way of Water,” which is Cameron’s first film to clear $100 million in a single weekend. The first “Avatar” opened in 2009 with $77 million domestically: a decent start but hardly one for the record books. But the film enjoyed unparalleled staying power, holding the No. 1 spot for seven weeks in a row and continuing to draw audiences for months. Thanks to pricey 3D tickets and repeat viewings, ticket sales eventually climbed to $760 million in North America and $2.92 billion globally.  \t“The Way of Water” will struggle to reach that benchmark, given the restrictions facing the COVID-battered box office. It won’t be playing in Russia, where the original film grossed $116 million. Though it is screening in China, the country’s box office has been struggling to rebound. Inaugural ticket sales in the country were below expectations at $57.1 million. In pandemic times, only three movies have crossed $1 billion worldwide and none have managed to hit $2 billion (though “Spider-Man: No Way Home” came close with $1.9 billion).", "Lucky for “The Way of Water” (though maybe not so lucky for theater owners), there’s not much competition through the rest of the year. However, its daunting 192-minute runtime could intimidate people from wanting to watch the movie again and again.  \tTurnout for “Avatar 2” was especially strong on Imax and 3D screens, with 62% of ticket sales coming from premium formats. Globally, the film made $48.8 million from Imax alone, registering as the company’s second-biggest weekend ever and highest December opening in history.  \t“As excited as we are about these early results, we anticipate a long and successful run for ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ as more people around the world book their ticket to Pandora for the epic storytelling and unmissable visual splendor of what James Cameron and his team have created,” says Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax.  \tGiven the hype around Cameron’s grand return to Pandora, rival studios opted to lay low so holdover titles rounded out the rest of box office charts. Another Disney blockbuster sequel, Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” slid to second place after five weeks at the No. 1 spot. The superhero epic added $5.3 million from 3,380 theaters, bringing its domestic tally to $418 million.

Animation for adults is a fact. It's happening. Let's call it cinema. I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation.\"[29] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision to not broadcast the award.[30]  Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG-13 or more, with a few of them —The Triplets of Belleville, Persepolis, Chico and Rita, The Wind Rises, Anomalisa, My Life as a Courgette, The Breadwinner, Loving Vincent, Isle of Dogs, I Lost My Body and Flee— having been nominated in this category, though none have won.[31][32]", "\"It's so good to know this art form we love so much - stop motion - is very much alive and well,\" said co-director Mark Gustafson.

An animated feature is defined by the Academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.[1][2][3]  The entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award's inception. If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category, the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films, otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist.[4]  For much of the Academy Awards' history, AMPAS was resistant to the idea of a regular award for animated features, considering there were simply too few produced to justify such consideration.[5] Instead, the Academy occasionally bestowed special Oscars for exceptional productions, usually for Walt Disney Pictures, such as for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1938,[6] and the Special Achievement Academy Award for the live action/animated hybrid Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1989[7] and Toy Story in 1996.", "As there's been a rise in popularity of Korean film and TV shows – especially since especially since the success of Netflix's \"Squid Games\" – more and more U.S.-based content is being reimagined for Korean dramas and actors.

In late August 2022, it was revealed by California’s Film & Television Tax Credit Program that Rebel Moon Part 2 had been awarded $16.6M in tax credits (on its budget of $83 million). About a decade ago, Rebel Moon was originally a Star Wars pitch developed by Zack Snyder. It would be a more mature take on the universe created by George Lucas and didn’t move beyond meaningful conversations after The Walt Disney Co. acquired Lucasfilm in 2012. Ironically, as we saw years later, a slightly more mature take on the universe would be the very thing to revitalize the franchise in The Mandalorian. At one point, Snyder and Newman, who was behind Narcos and Narcos Mexico, went down the path of making it into a series. Still, it was ultimately decided to make Rebel Moon a feature film, on which Snyder was actively working the past few years: “I’ve spent the last two or three years building out this universe. Every corner has to be painted in. I’ve been doing designs, constantly drawing and really cultivating its fertile ground to make this world fully realized.”  As Snyder has already launched multiple Army of the Dead projects for Netflix, the question is, will Rebel Moon be the same? Snyder’s answer to that is “hopefully.", "During the hinterland between Revenge of the Sith and The Force Awakens – a time when Lucasfilm's highest profile product was arguably the animated Star Wars: The Clone Wars T.V. series – Snyder pitched the idea as a possible extension to Lucas's galaxy. \"It was me saying, 'Give me the keys and let me take it for a spin,'\" Snyder said on the Happy Sad Confused podcast (via ScreenRant) back in 2021. \"We talked about it but it never [happened]. I've been working on it away from the Star Wars universe, on my own, as a sci-fi thing. It's still a sci-fi thing. It's the same story.\" Rebel Moon is Snyder's excuse to combine his love for Star Wars with his appreciation for Akira Kurosawa movies – in this case Seven Samurai. It won't be the first sci-fi movie to riff on the familiar tale of villagers recruiting a group of elite warriors to protect their homes, but with Netflix money behind it, it's sure to be rather more spectacular than the Roger Corman-produced Battle Beyond the Stars (itself an adaptation of classic Western The Magnificent Seven).  According to Netflix's official summary, Rebel Moon is the story of a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy that comes under threat from the forces of a tyrannical regent named Balisarius.", "When a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy is threatened by a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger becomes their best hope for survival.", "The Mummy and Kingsman: The Secret Service alum Sofia Boutella leads the New Moon cast as Kora, a young woman who will lead a rebellion to protect her home. Boutella stars with Ed Skrein, who’s portraying the tyrannical regent Balisarius. The ensemble cast also features Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, Bae Doona, Ray Fisher, and Corey Stoll, among others. As often happens in recent times, Rebel Moon might get a limited theatrical window. Netflix usually releases its biggest movies (like Extraction 2) in selected theaters, which is likely what will happen to Rebel Moon too.  When I'm not feasting my eyes on the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I'm probably watching some MMA fights. Dreaming of the United States. Sic Parvis Magna.", "Actually, Snyder is doing more than making two Rebel Moon movies. He’s technically making four. Each Rebel Moon film will receive two cuts, one that can be watched with your whole family and one that more mature and explicit aimed at adults. Snyder says, “I think for fans of mine and people who are ready to take a deeper, harder dive, that’ll be fun for them,” referring to the adult cuts of his upcoming Netflix films.

Answer · See more gaps · Learn more about contributing.", "Scream VI is a 2023 American slasher film directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. It is the sequel to Scream (2022) and the sixth installment in the Scream film series. The film stars Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, Hayden Panettiere, and Courteney Cox, all reprising their roles from previous installments, with Josh Segarra, Jack Champion, Devyn Nekoda, Liana Liberato, Tony Revolori, Samara Weaving, Henry Czerny, and Dermot Mulroney joining the ensemble cast. The plot follows a new Ghostface killer, who begins targeting the survivors of the \"Woodsboro legacy murders\" in New York City.  A sixth Scream film was announced just weeks after the successful debut of Scream (2022), with much of the cast signing on to reprise their roles alongside Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett's return. Filming took place in Montreal, Canada, from June to late August 2022. Neve Campbell did not reprise her role as Sidney Prescott due to a pay dispute, making this the first Scream film not to feature her. Brian Tyler composed the film's score, with Sven Faulconer co-scoring.", "That's about all we really know about the new movie, although Barrera has teased to Collider that the new movie is \"potentially a hundred times gorier\". \"There was a saying on set because Matt [Bettinelli-Olpin] and Tyler [Gillett] were always asking for more blood and more sweat,\" she explained. And although Sidney isn't back, Ortega has been promising fans that there are \"references\" to Sidney in the sixth movie. The previous movie appeared to position Barrera and Ortega's characters Sam and Tara as the new central characters of the franchise, especially with Sam's connection to the original movie as the daughter of Billy Loomis. This would naturally make her a target in the same way that Sidney was for the original trilogy. Fortunately, Scream avoided the obvious twist to make Sam a killer like her father, and we'd hope that any future movie would keep this approach. \"Our approach was that she has now accepted that Billy is a part of her. And while he's never going to not be a part of her, she has to now carry that forward,\" explained co-director Matt Bettinelli-Olpin to Fandom.", "I honestly don't believe that if I were a man and had done five instalments of a huge blockbuster franchise over 25 years, that the number that I was offered would be the number that would be offered to a man.  \"And in my soul, I just couldn't do that. I couldn't walk on set feeling that — feeling undervalued and feeling the unfairness, or lack of fairness, around that.\" The new movie will, however, bring back Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers and leads of the fifth movie Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega as sisters Sam and Tara Carpenter, respectively. Also returning from the previous movie are Jasmin Savoy Brown and Mason Gooding as Randy's niece and nephew Mindy and Chad Meeks-Martin. Roger Jackson will, of course, be back as the voice of Ghostface. There's also some news that might soften the blow of losing Sidney as Scream 4 star Hayden Panettiere is reprising her role as Kirby Reed in the new movie.  The new Scream movie will have the same creative team returning behind the scenes: directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and writers James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick.", "New to Scream VI are Spider-Man star Tony Revolori and former Home and Away star Samara Weaving, along with Henry Czerny, Dermot Mulroney, Jack Champion, Josh Segarra, Liana Liberato and Devyn Nekoda. We might have seen them in action in the trailers, but we're no clearer on who they're actually playing. The fifth movie also had a surprise cameo role for Skeet Ulrich's Billy Loomis, who was revealed to be the father of Sam. He is very much dead though, only appearing in her hallucinations, but that doesn't rule out similar appearances in the new movie. Other actors from 2020's Scream not returning for Scream VI, though for plot-related reasons, include David Arquette's Dewey Riley who was brutally murdered by Ghostface in the fifth movie. We could see Heather Matarazzo back as Martha Meeks after a brief cameo in 2020's Scream, which also had voice cameos from Drew Barrymore, Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy.  But not as their characters Casey, Stu and Randy who are surely all dead in the Scream universe... right? Scream VI will see Sam and Tara Carpenter attempt to leave Ghostface behind by moving to New York City, along with twins Chad and Mindy Meeks-Martin.

In one comedy club scene, for instance, Larry asks the audience: “Have you ever had one of those days where no matter how hard you try, nothing goes your way? Yeah, we’ve all been there.” Later, Fred says he’s planning to write a book about “how I managed to make it through the toughest times”. Larry offers a classic Seinfeld riposte: “You’ve certainly gone through a lot. It sounds like a great story. I’d certainly be interested in reading it when you’re finished.” Who’d have thought autogenerated characters would have too much empathy? The whole thing feels like how a 1980s sci-fi writer might imagine a robot-created TV show from the future. Which, of course, is exactly what it is. It feels disturbingly like the kind of content our corporate overlords might be feeding us in 20 years to melt our brains and ensure quiet compliance. “Technology is really convenient in a lot of ways, but it can also be dangerous,” says Fred in one of the show’s disturbingly self-aware lines. “I guess it’s up to us to decide when it’s worth taking the risk.” Credit to its creators for a remarkable achievement – a delightfully bizarre experiment that sheds a little more light on the question.", "The fourth season ends with 'The Pilot', an episode focusing on the casting, taping, and screening of the show-within-the-show, Jerry. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.[125] William Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing. Some entries include \"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\", \"George's Failed Quest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\", \"Elaine's Moral Character\", \"Kramer the 'Seducer'\", \"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\", \"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\", \"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\", and \"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\".[126]  Seinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s.", "The result feels closer to David Lynch than Jerry Seinfeld, with the cast of characters seemingly trapped in AI limbo, always on the verge of setting up a joke, waiting for a punchline that never comes.

The stream constantly cuts from the Seinfeld apartment to Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up segments, again, algorithmically generated jokes (and honestly, they’re not that far removed from Jerry Seinfeld’s limp one-liners). As an experiment in AI, it makes for an oddly fascinating watch, but the creators seem to have higher ambitions. Hartle went on to say: “As generative media gets better, we have this notion that at any point, you're gonna be able to turn on the future equivalent of Netflix and watch a show perpetually, nonstop as much as you want. You don't just have seven seasons of a show, you have seven hundred, or infinite seasons of a show that has fresh content whenever you want it.

There was a moment when “Jerry’s” talking about how the grocery story isn’t a great place to hear celebrity gossip. He said something like how it’s difficult to get juicy details while you’re picking up a carton of eggs. There’s a brief beat of silence before the laugh track kicks in, and I guffawed wondering if the AI put that laugh track there because it knows egg prices are absurd right now. There’s another bit where “Elaine” talks about how the city’s passing an ordinance against jaywalking and how she’ll never get anywhere in the city anymore. I don’t understand why, but I laughed along with the laugh track. AI programs are doing a lot these days, up to and including my very job. I’ve never seen an episode of Seinfeld, so I can’t vouch for whether or not an AI can faithfully reproduce what people tell me is one of the all-time great television shows.

Whether it’s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today.

On Wednesday, Google held an event in its Paris office where the tech giant detailed plans to use AI technology to radically change how people search for information online. Google’s event came one day after rival Microsoft announced a revamped version of Bing powered by a more advanced version of the AI used by ChatGPT. (Microsoft is investing billions in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.)           In the presentation Wednesday, a Google executive teased plans to use this technology to offer more complex and conversational responses to queries, including providing bullet points ticking off the best times of year to see various constellations and also offering pros and cons for buying an electric vehicle.

{"id": 249, "query": "who founded midjourney?", "ans": ["David Holz"], "label": [-1], "prediction": "I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.", "docs": ["The hardest part of [a commercial art project] is often at the beginning, when the stakeholder doesn’t know what they want and has to see some ideas to react to. Midjourney can help people converge on the idea they want much more quickly, because iterating on those concepts is very laborious. Another advantage for artists is it gives people confidence in areas they’re not confident in. Most if not all artists feel like there’s some part of art they can’t do well. It might be colors, composition, backgrounds. We have a famous character designer using our product and people ask him why would you use an AI since you’re so good already. And he said, “well, I’m only good at the character part. This is helping me build out the rest of the world.” About how many people are using the product? Millions are using it. Our Discord is over two million. It’s the biggest active Discord server by far now. Does Midjourney’s license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by the platform? Yes. But if you’re working for a company bigger than a million dollars in annual revenue, we ask that you buy a corporate license. How was the dataset built? It’s just a big scrape of the Internet. We use the open data sets that are published and train across those. And I’d say that’s something that 100% of people do. We weren’t picky.", "He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "So far though, Holz said there hadn't been any complaints, what's more, some famous artists who use the platform say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.” But if the problem does arise, Holz said the team is open to it, although they don’t have a process for that yet. Speaking of art style, Midjourney has some distinguishing features no other tool like this has. It's \"artistic\" in a way that the generated images look like paintings and never like photos. \"We definitely want it to not look like photos. We might make a realistic version at one point, but we wouldn’t want it to be the default. Perfect photos make me a little uncomfortable right now, though I could see legitimate reasons why you might want something more realistic.\" Midjourney's style is \"whimsical and abstract and weird.\" Holz shared that it has favorite colors (it uses a lot of blues and oranges) and faces. The developers don’t know why it happens, \"but there’s a particular woman’s face it likes to draw\" – people call it “Miss Journey.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that’s been surprising to me.", "\"They're using it as an emotional and intellectual reflective tool,\" he said. \"And that's really cool.\" Holz dislikes the idea of using Midjourney to create fake photographs. \"Using it editorially to create fake photos is extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"No one should do that.\" But he's more open to Midjourney as a source of commercial illustration, noting that The Economist ran a Midjourney graphic on its cover in June. \"We only recently allowed people to use it commercially,\" said Holz. \"For a long time, it was non-commercial only. And so one of the things we're doing is we're just watching it, what people are doing, and we might decide that we're not comfortable with some of that and then we're going to put in a rule saying you can no longer use it just for those things.\" Holz said he sees AI tools like Midjourney making artists better at what they do rather than making everyone a professional artist. \"An artist using these tools is always better than a regular person using these tools. At some point, might there be pressure to use these tools because you can make things that are so great? I think yes. But right now, I don't think it's quite there yet. But it will get shockingly better over the next two years."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Ready’s revamped advertising strategy includes partnering with companies that can improve Pinterest’s targeting and measurement capabilities. It is already working with LiveRamp, a California-based software company, to develop clean rooms, or digital spaces where advertisers and Pinterest can share their data.

The document provides information about Meta laying off employees and undergoing restructuring but does not specify the exact number of layoffs in November.", "docs": ["Meta joins other tech companies, such as Snap, that have laid off employees as economic conditions have grown more challenging. While many of these companies boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, some of the largest ones have reported financial results in recent weeks that showed they are feeling the fallout of global economic jitters. Last week, Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, laid off roughly half the company’s 7,500 employees, saying the social media service was losing $4 million a day. “These cycles of boom and bust are incredibly destructive within organizations because people employed there feel like they don’t know where they stand,” said Sandra J. Sucher, a management professor at Harvard. By rapidly hiring across all departments during the pandemic, Mr. Zuckerberg had set up his company to need reductions in staff, she said. Mr. Zuckerberg has been telegraphing that Meta will have to clamp down on costs, starting with cutting back on many of the lavish perks that employees once enjoyed. In March, he announced that the company was trimming or eliminating free services like laundry and dry cleaning. He also scaled back free dinner offerings, making it harder for employees to take home dinner for themselves and their families. In July, Mr. Zuckerberg warned employees that the company was experiencing “one of the worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and in September he announced a hiring freeze. Last month, he warned that “teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year.", "And I think that's a real tone shift from the go-go times in - at least for the earnings of tech companies during the pandemic, as you said, when Meta was counting on - and a lot of tech companies were counting on - a fundamental change in the way people operate. And that hasn't really panned out. And so now... PFEIFFER: That it might have been just temporary. SCHECHNER: Well, it appears to have been, at least in some ways, temporary. Even Meta's reversing its position on remote work in some ways and encouraging people to come back to the office. PFEIFFER: Interesting. You know, Zuckerberg has said things like the layoffs were caused by things like rising interest rates, geopolitical tension, new regulations. Do you, Sam, based on your reporting, buy that? Do you believe that - those reasons? SCHECHNER: I think those confluence of factors certainly are playing a role. And I think - you mentioned regulations. You know, Meta has to comply with a growing number of new rules and regulations. You know, there's new regulations coming into effect in the European Union that are going to require some big changes to how the company operates. There's changes that they've had to make because of, you know, privacy moves by Apple to cut off some of the data that they've been using that have also cut into their revenue. So I think all of those things together are factors.", "Meta is far from the only Big Tech company to undergo layoffs amid higher inflation, recession fears and a whiplash in pandemic-induced demand. In the first months of this year, Amazon                              (AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft                              (MSFT) have all confirmed major job cuts impacting tens of thousands of tech workers.     Silicon Valley layoffs go from bad to worse         Shares of Meta rose more than 4% in early trading Tuesday following the announcement.            When the first round of job cuts was announced in November, Zuckerberg blamed himself at the time for the company’s over-hiring earlier in the pandemic. Meta  nearly doubled its headcount between March 2020 and September of last year, as the Covid-19 crisis led to a surge in demand for digital services.             But the situation changed radically for the social media giant and other tech companies as pandemic restrictions eased and people returned to their offline lives. Meta’s core business was also hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple                              (AAPL) and advertisers tightening budgets amid recession fears.             In his post on Tuesday announcing the latest cost-cutting efforts at Meta, Zuckerberg called the last year “a humbling wake-up call.”            “The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably,” he wrote.", "“We are a technology company, and our ultimate output is what we build for people,” Zuckerberg said. As part of the restructuring, the company will also increase the number of direct reports each manager has. Zuckerberg told analysts in February that the Meta plans “on cutting projects that aren’t performing or may no longer be crucial” while simultaneously “removing layers of middle management to make decisions faster.” “A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster,” Zuckerberg’s message said. Still, Meta continues to spend billions of dollars developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies required to build the digital universe coined the metaverse. The company’s Reality Labs division that’s tasked with creating the metaverse lost about $13.7 billion in 2022 on $2.16 billion of revenue.

Although she said she can often come off as sarcastic and cynical, the emoji and punctuation Your Move used in its replies highlighted her playful side, which she said is usually more likely to come out in person. Taylor Margot, the founder of Keys AI, a tool built to help people communicate via text, said that a significant portion of Keys users employ it for dating-app conversations. He said he understands the skepticism that comes with new technology, especially when it is applied to something as personal as dating, but believes in the technology’s ability to foster deeper human connection. “It’s about teaching people to be more curious and empathetic,” he said. “It’s not about just giving people a snappy response or openers. I’m truly trying to change how people communicate and build meaningful relationships.” None of the users The Post spoke to reported disclosing their use of AI dating tools to their matches or dates. Margot said he thinks that will change soon. “It’s the early phase of the adoption curve of AI,” he said. “Remember when people didn’t want to share that they met on a dating app? That’s where we are now with people admitting they use AI to communicate better rather than doing it themselves.", "“Some of the responses were so absurd that they ended up being funny, but not in the way the app likely intended.” He said he doesn’t plan on using the app again. “I anticipate that I’ll continue these conversations manually,” Lloyd said.", "Careers", "Mirakyan's interest in an app like his, however, seems to go deeper than Lloyd's term paper comparison.

At the same time, however, balance is definitely still needed here. Romance is one of the most human things out there, and the digital dating world is robotic enough as it is. Do we really want everyone on the apps just passing AI-generated quips and complements back and forth for eternity?

Peter Vermes, the longtime coach and general manager of Sporting Kansas City, has a similar — though not as varied — résumé as Stewart’s. Vermes was one of the first American-born players to carve out a career in Europe, and he captained the 1990 World Cup team. He knows the U.S. player pool inside out and also has experience in the international game. But would the longest-tenured coach in MLS be willing to leave the sideline?   Another possibility is John Thorrington, the GM of MLS Cup champ LAFC. Viewed as a rising C-suite star, Thorrington won four U.S. caps and was employed by clubs in England, Canada, Germany and the U.S. during his playing career. Other highly regarded domestic candidates like Tim Bezbatchenko and Garth Lagerwey have no international experience. (In any case, Lagerwey just took over Atlanta United after a wildly successful spell leading the Seattle Sounders.) Meantime, few foreign execs have intricate knowledge of U.S. Soccer and its teams. One intriguing name who also happens to be available is Ivan Gazidis.", "57  Sporting director Earnie Stewart is leaving U.S. Soccer and will return to the Netherlands to join Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven, the federation announced Thursday. Additionally, U.S. men’s national team general manager Brian McBride is moving on after three years in his role. Here’s what you need to know: U.S. Soccer hired Stewart in 2018 as the USMNT’s first general manager, and he led the hiring search that resulted in Berhalter becoming the national team’s coach. Once Stewart was promoted to sporting director, he helped hire McBride to take over as GM. The departures of Stewart and McBride leave the USMNT with a completely blank slate. The USMNT now has no head coach, no general manager and no sporting director overseeing the program. That’s a daunting position, but it also presents a huge opportunity for the federation ahead of the 2026 World Cup that the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico. Advertisement “I know this moment feels a bit uncertain,” USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone said on Thursday, “but what it actually is is a clean canvas.” U.S. Soccer CEO J.T.", "A former deputy MLS commissioner, Gazidis was AC Milan’s CEO until last month and spent a decade running current Premier League leader Arsenal before that.  How long until the USMNT has a full-time coach?  U.S. Soccer was hoping to have either Berhalter or his successor in place by early March at the latest. The USMNT has CONCACAF Nations League games against Grenada and El Salvador that month, with the Nations League finals and CONCACAF Gold Cup scheduled for this summer.  Now it seems likely that the men won’t have a coach until the end of the summer at the soonest, with interim manager Anthony Hudson staying on until at least then.   That’s hardly ideal. U.S. Soccer was heavily criticized for not signing Berhalter until late 2018; interim boss Dave Sarachan ran the squad for more than a year after the Americans failed to qualify for that World Cup. But Berhalter still had almost four entire years to build toward Qatar.   Now the Americans are almost guaranteed not to have a full-time leader less than three years before the 2026 World Cup that they’re co-hosting with Canada and Mexico kicks off.   In what ways does this impact the U.S. women?   It shouldn’t.", "\"We were not able to focus — in the way we would all think we want to and should — on growing youth and adult participation; on growing the number of referees in this country; on growing the number of coaches,\" Batson said. Those discussions with Stewart led to further conversations with other U.S. Soccer staffers and stakeholders around the country. And in their work with Sportsology, the consulting firm brought in to lead the sporting director search, \"we got validation through the review as to how other federations [around the world] are organized, as well as feedback from our team around what's working well, and where are some challenges,\" Batson said. \"So,\" he said, \"put all those things together, and that's what's led us to do this.\" He and Cone acknowledged that there will be overlap between the sporting director position and the new position — in the talent identification realm, for example. And of course, for now, both are extremely conceptual; both could continue to evolve. But the new delineation, Batson explained, is that the sporting director will be \"looking at player pools of thousands or low tens of thousands, [and] coaching pools of hundreds\" — the very top of the pyramid. \"As an organization, we also need to be thinking strategically around player pools of millions, coaching pools of hundreds of thousands, referee pools of hundreds of thousands\" — and that's what the person who fills the new position will do.", "Soccer calls its extended national teams (beach soccer, deaf soccer and more). It will also create a job description that better aligns with the skill sets of many qualified sporting directors throughout global soccer. Batson, speaking from the federation's annual general meeting in San Diego, told a small group of reporters that, in interviews with prospective sporting directors, candidates have given \"a lot of very positive feedback ... around the narrowing of focus.\" \"Folks have been pretty direct around appreciating that evolution,\" Batson said. What U.S. Soccer is looking for in its next sporting director, he said, is a \"pro at identifying, attracting, retaining and making successful elite-level sporting talent, and someone who can own our technical vision.\" And while that description is vague, and seems less influential than sporting director roles at clubs — where executives can sign and sell players, and actually shape the team on the field immediately — it will be more refined that it was previously. Batson said discussions about the \"evolution\" of the role began in Qatar, between him and Stewart. He realized, in those conversations and others, that \"to run our national team programs is more than a full-time job.\" This left other areas under Stewart's purview lacking the attention they deserved and required."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

As that lending plays out, Koch thinks it could begin to weigh on the commercial real estate market. \"[Regional banks] have this dual pressure from both deposit outflow and their commercial real estate exposure, and that's going to put pressure on those banks,\" she explained. \"It's going to put pressure on their ability to extend credit, which in turn is going to put pressure on the economy and jobs. We are quite worried about that, and that really underscores the base view as to why we're in the more bearish camp.\" Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The back is clad in Gorilla Glass Victus, which should keep it safe from scratches, and the frame is polished aluminum.  The Google Pixel Fold has a 7.6-inch 1840 x 2208 OLED foldable display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 5.8-inch 1080 x 2092 OLED cover display with a 120Hz refresh rate. Those specs are broadly in line with the screen specs of rival devices. The Z Fold 4, for example, has the same size foldable screen but a slightly bigger 6.2-inch cover display. However, the Pixel Fold has a wider profile, which should mean the cover screen feels less narrow than on Samsung’s rival. Google has also worked to minimize the crease in the foldable screen as much as possible.  There’s a triple-lens rear camera on the Pixel Fold, just like on the Pixel 7 Pro, though it doesn’t use the same sensors.

For example, Google plans to offer a trade-in option to swap in a current Pixel, iPhone or an Android-powered phone for a discount on the Pixel Fold.

But, understanding that this is a first-generation product and when factoring in the relatively high price of the phone, his excitement was tempered somewhat. Our readers are largely on the fence. While a sliver over 50% of polled readers believe that the Pixel Fold is “hot,” only 24% of readers in a secondary poll admitted to pre-ordering the device already, with 23% not completely convinced just yet. A fairly sizeable 38% of readers don’t plan to buy the device. As Google’s first foldable, the Pixel Fold aims to provide a different experience to the Pixel 7 series. For starters, the company has optimized over 50 Google apps for the larger screen. Some of these apps will be Pixel-first and won’t be available on foldables from other brands. Google has also worked with some major apps like Spotify, Disney Plus, TikTok, eBay, Canva, and more to optimize them for the inner folding display. Streaming apps like Netflix, YouTube, and even Peloton support the Pixel Fold’s Tabletop mode (pictured above) for hands-free viewing. Besides app optimizations, which Google says is a continuous effort, the Pixel Fold also has some cool multitasking tricks up its sleeve. You can drag and drop images, videos, links, and more between apps on the two sides of the display.", "Based on our hands-on experience, this was a good decision by Google. The Pixel Fold is far more accommodating to use folded than the Galaxy Z Fold, thanks to this wider display. In terms of thickness, the Pixel Fold measures just over 12mm deep without the camera bump when folded compared to the 14.2mm measurement of the Galaxy Z Fold 4. The inner display of the Pixel Fold measures 7.6 inches and is protected by ultra-thin glass (UTG), just like the Galaxy foldables. You get a 120Hz refresh rate both inside and outside. The 180-degree Fluid Friction hinge that takes the phone from its folded to unfolded state and opens at any angle is made of stainless steel. Google calls it the “most durable hinge of any foldable phone.” This claim is based on the company’s own durability testing, which included 200,000 folds and tumble drop tests of one meter. Despite the testing, Google clarifies that the Pixel Fold is not drop-proof. Like the current crop of foldables, the Pixel Fold is not exempt from the display crease curse. During our hands-on time with the phone, we did note a noticeable crease down the middle of the main display. It’s actually more pronounced than its competition from Samsung and especially OPPO.

But the company hasn’t just been working on software. During the conference’s keynote address, Google showed off a handful of new gadgets — including a budget smartphone, its first foldable phone, and a combination tablet/smart home display — as part of an ongoing plan to pitch itself as creator of uniquely clever devices. While some of these products, like the folding phone and the home-focused hybrid tablet, are firsts for Google, they aren’t completely novel. Traditional Android tablets made by companies like Samsung have existed almost as long as Android itself has, though Google stopped making its own nearly eight years ago. Meanwhile, folding smartphones first burst onto the scene in 2019, and have slowly been creeping into the mainstream ever since. These new devices also arrive at a critical time for Google, a company deeply invested in AI research forced to play defense against new (and unexpected) rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft. It’s not clear what role — if any — Google gadgets like these will play in furthering the company’s AI plans. For now, though, Google hopes that features powered by AI and machine learning can give these products an edge the next time you go gadget shopping. Here’s what you should know about the devices Google is trying to sell you on.", "I suspect that in a few years, foldable phones will probably fall in price to replace current phones with the “pro” moniker and will make up the new high end of the market.

The big bezels around the sides of the screen don’t look great, but they’re pretty comfortable places for your fingers to rest on when holding the phone. For better or worse, the Fold — like the much cheaper 7a — uses the same Tensor G2 processor as the company’s Pixel 7 phones, released last October. In our experience, that means the Fold should be plenty fast for daily use, if not quite as speedy as some other premium phones. For most people, though, the AI features Google uses this chip for — from improving the sound of your phone calls to automatically tweaking photos captured by the Fold’s three rear cameras — may be worth the trade-off. The catch: Where do we start? At nearly $1,800, the Fold is plain out of reach to many. Sure, it’s not alone there — Samsung’s premium Galaxy Z Fold 4 costs the same — but even luxe traditional smartphones cost hundreds less. And because the Fold physically bends in half, there’s a great chance of some kind of physical failure over time.

The uptick in this metric implies growth in the supply of candidates looking for work, which is good news for the economy and for the staffing industry. The prime age labor force participation rate (ages 25 through 54, those in the prime of their working years, being largely done with their education and too young to retire) recovered to its pre-pandemic peak of 83.1% in February and remained unchanged in March. Participation among people ages 55 and older continues to decline; the increasing participation rate represents people under 25 finding or looking for work. These trends suggest that labor scarcity will remain a challenge, particularly in the supply of experienced candidates, and scarcity will continue to support demand for staffing and workforce solutions even as economic growth slows. The March decline in Temporary help employment was the first decline since December. Overall, for 2023, employment in Temporary help services remains up by 9,300. Though nonetheless below the record-high levels seen in 2022, this remains consistent with our expectation for a plateauing of the industry in 2023.

When Biden took office, there were fewer jobs than unemployed job seekers. The number of job openings in March is set to be released May 2. Labor Force Participation — One reason many job openings go unfilled is that millions of Americans left the workforce during the pandemic and haven’t returned. The labor force participation rate (the percentage of the total population over age 16 that is either employed or actively seeking work) has slowly recovered during Biden’s time, from 61.3% in January 2021 to 62.6% in March. That still leaves the rate well short of the pre-pandemic level of 63.3% for February 2020. The rate peaked at 67.3% more than two decades ago, during the first four months of 2000. Labor Department economists project that the rate will trend down to 60.1% in 2031, “primarily because of an aging population.” Manufacturing Jobs — During the presidential campaign, Biden promised he had a plan to create a million new manufacturing jobs — and whether it’s his doing or not, the number is rising briskly.

Professional and business services added 43,000 jobs, though there was some variability below the headline number.

That sector has been trending downward and has lost a net 174,000 jobs since March 2022, its peak. Leisure and hospitality employment increased by 31,000, below its average of 73,000 jobs per month for the last six months but still a notable addition. The industry, which is still about 400,000 jobs below its prepandemic level, has raced to accommodate consumers eager to unload money especially at restaurants and bars despite concerns about a pullback in spending. Food services and drinking establishments alone added 25,000 jobs. Retail trade added 7,700 jobs after a marginal decline in March.

The change in temporary help services employment in January was revised up from gain of +15,300 jobs to a gain of +16,600, and the previously estimated gain of +6,800 in February was revised down to a gain of +3,400. With these revisions, temporary help services employment in February was -2,100 lower than previously reported. SIA’s Perspective:  The US economy added +236,000 jobs in March, in-line with expectations and slightly above the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, which called for a gain of +230,000.

Downward revisions to previous two months altered the spring employment picture meaningfully, subtracting a total of 149,000 jobs. That brings the three-month average to 222,000 jobs, a clear slowdown from the 400,000 added on average in 2022. Since early 2021, the labor market has been uncommonly tight as employers struggled to reverse a sudden mass layoff and navigate huge shifts in the demand for goods and services. The unemployment rate reached its lowest point since the 1960s. Wages at the low end of the pay scale rose faster than they had in decades. All of that has benefited groups that have historically been at a disadvantage in the labor market. The unemployment rate for Black Americans reached its lowest point on record in April, at 4.7 percent, and the gap between the unemployment rates of white and Black people was also the smallest ever measured. The share of working-age people participating in the labor market reached 83.3 percent, matching a level not seen since 2008.

What’s important is getting that string — the prompt — correct. It’s also interesting to see how the platform helps you find that prompt. With Bing’s OpenAI tools, it’s better to start with a relatively open-ended query and then refine your results. It’s an interactive platform that is designed to help you find what you need, and the best results come from those interactions. Simple queries are handed off to the traditional search algorithms, as there’s no value in using the compute resources required for an AI-powered search. Then there’s the larger question of training data. While large language models like GPT are trained on public data, that’s less important when it comes to working with the data stored in your own applications. Again, Azure OpenAI offers some clues, with the option to use a custom model that blends the existing GPT LLM with a selection of your own data. Both Dynamics and Microsoft 365 have their own data models, which would work well as part of an expanded Prometheus model, especially as Bing already uses that data in its enterprise search mode.", "Where OpenAI’s demo services only take input from a text box, Microsoft injects additional context, including location, date and time, while splitting queries up into multiple parallel searches, aiming to speed up requests and improve the quality of results. Results are parsed and used as inputs into the model, looking for fresh insights that can drive additional searches, an approach that Microsoft described as a “virtuous loop.” The initial implementation of this AI tooling is in both its Edge browser and Bing search engine. Microsoft gave a picture of how the service will eventually appear in the rest of the company’s productivity tooling. In Edge, a new Bing sidebar lets you take searches outside the traditional browser, giving a clue to how it could be implemented in the familiar Office applications. The new sidebar design Microsoft has been rolling out across Office is very much like the Bing AI tooling that’s being trialed in the developer release of the Edge browser. While Microsoft has yet to announce any plans to provide API-level access to this tooling, it would be surprising if it wasn’t on the company’s radar. Microsoft is first and foremost a platform company, and its use of generative AI is clearly setting a pointer to what it thinks its next platform should be — assistive AI.

The software uses machine learning to identify objects like cars, people or camera straps. it uses machine learning to replace parts of the image with something else. It might not be personalized and adapt to your individual editing style, but this isn't the same as making a broad statement that it's not AI. It is, by all reasonable current standards. Another fallacy.  Currently, the machine does not learn, it is programed and operates within given parameters.  And, most of us call it a computer or computer chip.  Precision in language. AI is a tool to be used by creative people. Mindlessly repeating that it has \"ruined photography\" suggests a lack of creativity. We've been here before - many times over. The only thing AI will ruin will be stock image libraries - and that's probably a good thing given the pittance photographers are paid.

This smart use of technology enables you to work faster than ever before so you have way more time to be creative. Today we ship Neural Filters, Sky Replacement, the new Discover panel, and two new Refine Edge Selections improvements all built on artificial intelligence, in addition to many other great new features you will use every day. Neural Filters is a major breakthrough in AI-powered creativity and the beginning of a complete reimagination of filters and image manipulation inside Photoshop. This first version ships with a large set of new filters. Many of these filters are still in the beta quality state. We’ve decided to ship them to you now so you can try them out and give feedback and help shape the future of AI in Photoshop. Neural Filters is part of a new machine learning platform, which will evolve and get better over time – expanding on what’s possible exponentially. The new Sky Replacement feature intelligently separates the sky from the foreground and allows you to create the ultimate images with beautiful, dynamic skies in just a few clicks.

Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.", "Vision Pro is Apple's wearable \"spatial computing\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit.", "Optic ID can be used like Face ID for unlocking the device, authenticating purchases, and as a password alternative.  Apple included an exterior camera that is able to capture 3D video and 3D photos that are viewable in 3D on the Vision Pro. Apple says that these are like reliving a memory in person because of the \"incredible depth\" that's available.   The camera gives a clear indicator when recording is turned on so that the headset cannot be used to secretly record video. There are speakers on either side of the headset, with the speakers built into the straps that are connected to the frame. The speakers feature dual-driver audio pods that are positioned next to each ear, and they are able to analyze a room's acoustic properties to adapt the sound to match the space.  The speakers support spatial audio for an immersive surround sound experience, plus there are also six microphones for phone calls, video calls, and voice commands.  Apple Vision Pro is powered by a pair of chips. The main processor is the M2, which is the same chip that was first introduced in the 2022 MacBook Air. It is responsible for processing content, running the visionOS operating system, executing computer vision algorithms, and providing graphical content.   A second R1 chip is responsible for all of the information coming from the cameras, sensors, and microphones.", "You can see these, as well as loads of other details, in our 180-plus image gallery below: 1/189 1/189 The headset has a glass front and an aluminum frame, containing five sensors, 12 cameras, a 4K display for each eye, and a computer that’s apparently cooled with a fan. The headset mask (which Apple dubs a “Light Seal”) and strap (which Apple dubs a “Head Band”) are cloth-lined and modular, and Apple says they can flex to fit to a variety of face shapes and head sizes. The Head Band is ribbed and fits around the back of your head, and you can swap different sizes and styles of band. Zeiss has created custom optical inserts that magnetically attach to the lenses for people who wear glasses. It has an external battery that lasts up to two hours and can connect via a “supple woven cable” so it slips into a pocket, or you can plug it into external power and use it all day. Apple promises that the display will be unprecedentedly sharp and can deliver 4K video. The system uses an M2, but it also includes a new chip called the R1.

And by and large, I attribute that to a recognition that this is just the new normal, the constant curveballs that will be thrown at us but at the same time, given how successfully so many of these organizations have navigated through these things over the past couple of years, a growing confidence that we’ll be able to continue to navigate the issues that get thrown at us and grow our businesses. But to do that, we are absolutely seeing a new brand of leadership emerge, grounded in resilience, in agility, in a learning mindset. These are the most important leadership attributes in an environment where we should just expect that change and disruption are going to be at a consistently high level of intensity. Murray: The problems aren’t going away, Joe, right? You have to manage through them. Ucuzoglu: I had a CEO say to me recently that, if you put together a list of the top 20 risks one week, something big is going to hit the next week, and it probably isn’t even on that list. And that’s just a reflection of the number of different phenomena in the world right now and the level of complexity that businesses are managing through. Murray: Joe. Thank you. Ucuzoglu: Alan, it’s a real pleasure.", "I think we've learned a ton because we've always had diverse providers in our community, and we've always done cultural care matching. So we have a lot of learnings that we're leveraging as we continue to build out this product.  I really think creating an equitable health system starts with bringing diverse experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives together. In your opinion, what role does a CEO play in society?  It's changing a lot. I think that in the past, it was, of course, a CEO's job was to maximize shareholder value. I think that given that, you know, there hasn't been as much leadership at the government level, I think people are looking for more meaning and guidance by the leaders that they see in their day-to-day lives, including in the workplace. I think CEOs of companies are stepping up to fill some of these voids. So, for instance, with George Floyd's murder, I don't think 20 years ago you would have seen companies donate to charities or make investments as a reaction. But we made that choice to do so because we felt it was really important. Everyone at Maven wants a better world right now, so how do we do our part?", "One of the big things we're going to be focusing on is further personalization across all the journeys our members go through. There's a first-time mom's journey and a third-time mom's journey. There's the IVF journey versus the surrogacy journey. We're also deeply concerned about health equity. There's the journey of the single mom who works an hourly job. How do we make sure our model and technology is compatible with the pain points and needs she has? We put the chief medical officer for the home, whoever that is, at the center of our platform. Internally, we're going to continue to focus on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.  DEI appears to be an internal priority at Maven. Tell me about your decision to offer unlimited vacation, flexible work, and 14 weeks of paid parental leave.  I think it's really important when you're looking at DEI to actually be very principled in your approach. What are the principles? What are the problems you're trying to solve for? And then build that into your KPIs and policies.  We treat DEI like any other business goal, just like revenue or sales. So that ensures we're creating positive change. We wanted to ensure that a mom, a parent, has enough bonding time with their child in those first crucial months."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

He went on to win the Pacific-12 Conference title in Boulder, Colo., near his hometown, and was named Golfweek’s player of the year. Clark told reporters this week that his mother’s advice to him before every tournament was to “play big.” He heeded that mantra this week, especially on the weekend when he found himself in the final pairing with Fowler each of the last two days. While Sunday’s round wasn’t perfect, his up-and-downs on Nos. 8, 9, 11 and 17 eventually won him the championship. The bogey on the par-5 eighth when he barely moved the ball on his third shot in thick greenside rough was reminiscent of his bogey save late Saturday on the 17th hole. Most observers were expecting McIlroy, Fowler or Scheffler – three of the biggest names in golf – to hoist the trophy at day’s end. They received the most boisterous roars on Sunday, but all three failed to match the adulation on the 7,359-yard George C. Thomas Jr. design that underwent a restoration by Gil Hanse in preparation for the first U.S. Open in Los Angeles since 1948.  Newly minted U.S. Open champion is congratulated by gracious fellow competitor Rickie Fowler after Sunday's final round.", "6 million — his second such cash prize in the last six weeks — he moves to No. 2 in the Ryder Cup standings. Smith shot 67 to finish fourth. Tommy Fleetwood became the first player with two rounds of 63 in the U.S. Open and finished in a tie for fifth with Fowler and Min Woo Lee (67). Fleetwood also shot 63 at Shinnecock Hills in the final round of 2018. That was a fitting finish in one respect — a U.S. Open that had the lowest 18-hole scores on Thursday (Fowler and Xander Schauffele at 62) ended with the lowest scoring average for 72 holes (71.76) in U.S. Open history.

All Rights Reserved.", "But since returning to instructor Butch Harmon, the 2015 Players champion who finished in the top five of all four majors in 2014, had slowly regained his confidence and form. He even said after Round 3 on Saturday that he wasn’t afraid to fail because of what he’s endured the past two years. After shattering the 36-hole birdie mark with 18, he could only muster five on the weekend, including two in the final round against seven bogeys. “I just didn’t have it today,” said the 34-year-old Fowler, whose engaging personality makes him one of the most-liked players in the game. “Iron play was very below average and didn’t make anything. That’s a big thing in majors, especially on a Sunday.” Meanwhile, Scheffler just couldn’t get hot with his putter. The 2022 Masters champion, who had an eagle-birdie finish on Saturday, carded an even-par 70 with three birdies and three bogeys. That’s normally a recipe for success in a U.S. Open, but the 2022 runner-up needed more fireworks to overcome a three-stroke deficit to start the day on a course that yielded 10 rounds of 65 or better this week. Clark carded a first-round 64 that was only two strokes off the record-setting performances of Fowler and Xander Schauffele.", "Three times a runner-up, eight times in the top-10: the bittersweet tag of being one of the best golfers to never win a major remains stuck to the fan-favorite Californian.           World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler finished third, three shots behind Clark at seven-under and one ahead of Australian Cameron Smith in fourth.           Level in fifth with Fowler were Australian Min Woo Lee and England’s Tommy Fleetwood, who was mere inches away from leveling Fowler and Schauffele’s historic record following a blistering final round.           Fleetwood shot two eagles and four birdies to soar 32 places up the leaderboard, but saw his closing seven-foot birdie effort roll agonizingly wide to end on a 63.           Defending champion Matt Fitzpatrick finished tied-17th at one-under overall, as did last month’s PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka.           The fourth and final men’s major of the year, The Open Championship, gets underway at Royal Liverpool Golf Club on July 20.           After an agonizing bogey finish to his third round, any hopes Fowler had of wiping the slate clean were quickly dashed. The world No. 45 made a nightmare start as his first ever share of a 54-hole major lead evaporated, a string of errant tee shots compounding two bogeys across his first six holes.", "McClure is also targeting another golfer for his 2023 U.S. Open one and done picks that excels in big events against top flight competition.

Last year, Amazon held its first-ever Prime Early Access Sale, which was effectively a second Prime Day sale. In 2022, that Prime sale went from 3 a.m. ET on Oct. 11 through midnight on Oct.", "In 2022, Amazon held a second Prime Day event dubbed Prime Early Access Sale. Amazon said Prime members ordered more than 100 million items from merchants during the Early Access sale. Prime Day, which features deals on many products on Amazon.com, began in 2015 as a celebration of Amazon’s 20th year in business. It turned into a summer sales holiday designed to drum up additional business for Amazon — and the retailer’s marketplace sellers — before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shoppers. Amazon Prime Day takes place in more than 20 countries, including: Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon’s sales on Prime Day hit $12.09 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 12 and 13. That’s up 8.1% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2021, which ran from June 21 through 22. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon’s 2020 event.   Prime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus pandemic.", "12.  Now we do not yet have confirmation that Amazon will have another Early Access Sale this year. But should Amazon decide to have another Early Access Sale — and there's no reason to think it won't — you can be pretty sure it'll take place around the same time in October. Basically, the second Prime Day event served as a preview to Black Friday deals, which means it would almost have to take place at the same time in the calendar.  If, for some reason, Amazon decides to skip the Early Access Sale this year, then you'll probably have to wait until Summer 2024 for the next Prime Day. Over the last few years, Prime Day has fallen in June or July.  If you missed out on the latest Prime Day, fear not, because retailers likes Walmart and Target have started their own sales to rival Prime Day. And those deals are still for the taking.

I don’t know what it was, but I just had this vision God revealed to me that we were going to come back. We were going to be part of a Super Bowl. We were going to win it, and somehow, I was going to walk off the field as MVP of the game. \"And I shared that with my wife because I couldn’t share that with anyone else, obviously, what that was.

Williams has reported on the NFL for more than a decade, covering the Los Angeles Rams for Sports Illustrated, the Los Angeles Chargers for ESPN and the Seattle Seahawks for the Tacoma News Tribune. Follow him on Twitter @eric_d_williams.", "This article was published more than 1 year ago Aaron Donald grabbed Joe Burrow by the waist and swung him around three times as if he was the lead and Burrow was the follow in a waltz pairing. Around and around Burrow went, in that violent spin before he hit the ground, the last dance in an intimate un-love story. The strange pairing of ferocity and joy, like everything else Donald did with so much intensity in the Super Bowl, cut through all the overhyped gigantism of the occasion with memorable physical detail. Super Bowls have become so colossal in scale and technology that the players can seem as remote as game animations, framed figments in 4K HDR video. That seemed especially so at SoFi Stadium with that haloed canopy ceiling and the image-casting LEDs, the panoramic fisheye lenses and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson booming about “4.5 billion years” as if the game was a speeding piece of space junk. But then here came Donald leading the Los Angeles Rams with such palpable sweat and yearning want. Then running off the field triumphantly pointing at his ring finger and in the postgame interview saying, as those finely distinguishable tears rolled down his face along with the perspiration, “We’re going to play in the confetti for a minute, man.” Then the big man did that, sat in that blizzard of colorful snow with arms clutching his children.", "7] The most recent Super Bowl MVP, from Super Bowl LVII held on February 12, 2023, is Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.  Tom Brady is the only player to have won five Super Bowl MVP awards (four with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers); Joe Montana won three and four  other players—Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, Eli Manning, and Patrick Mahomes—have won the award twice.[8] Starr and Bradshaw are the only ones to have won it in back-to-back years. The MVP has come from the winning team every year except 1971, when Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley won the award despite the Cowboys' loss in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts.[9] Harvey Martin and Randy White were named co-MVPs of Super Bowl XII, the only time co-MVPs have been chosen.[10][11] Including the Super Bowl XII co-MVPs, seven Cowboys players have won Super Bowl MVP awards, the most of any NFL team. Quarterbacks have earned the honor 32 times in 57 games (and 58 awards).[12]  From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car from General Motors as a part of their MVP award. However since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50.[13]", "His huge blasts of feeling cut through all the artificial supersizing and booming overdubs of the Super Bowl. But what’s interesting about Donald, what makes him an all-time great and probably the true Super Bowl MVP, is his ability to control and direct that feeling in such an intelligent way. There is a fascinating restraint-and-release, shift-and-surge control with which Donald plays. Anyone can be a wild man, but Donald has a regulator that allows him to be at his most powerful and detonating when it counts, to outsmart and outmaneuver the opponent in the face of all the violence to ruin the most important play. That’s what makes him “an official game wrecker,” as Morris calls him. Recall a close, heated 2018 game between the Rams and the Seattle Seahawks, when a fight broke out near the Rams’ sideline between Donald and one of the Seahawks, Justin Britt. As the two men began shoving, other players surrounded them. A thrown punch might have meant ejection from the game. Rams Coach Sean McVay ran into the melee and frantically peeled players away trying to get to his star defender — “Get out!” he ordered, “Get out!” — until he reached Donald. He took Donald by the arm, got in front of him. “This is where you’re great. It shows up right here,” McVay exhorted him. “Aaron, love you, this is why you’re great.", "The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80 percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20 percent.[1][2] The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones;[1] Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team.[3] Voters cannot select an entire unit.[4]  The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine.[5] Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL.[5] At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP.[6] Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}
