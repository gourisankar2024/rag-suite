I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember hearing something about the Nobel Prizes around October 2021. I think each year they announce different categories like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and the Economic Sciences. So, the Literature prize is usually announced in early October.\n\nI think I saw some news articles around that time. Maybe I can recall the name. Wait, I think it was a writer I wasn't familiar with before. I believe his first name started with an 'A' or something. Maybe Abdul... something. \n\nLooking at the documents provided, there are a few mentions. One document says, \"Dr. Bashir Abu-Manneh, Head of the university's School of English, said: 'It is right that professor Gurnah is being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature...'\" Okay, so Gurnah. That rings a bell. Another document mentions, \"Abdulrazak Gurnah delivered his Nobel Prize lecture in literature on 7 December 2021.\" So, the full name is Abdulrazak Gurnah.\n\nAnother document has a headline from October 11, 2021, stating, \"Abdulrazak Gurnah Is Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\" It also mentions he's the first Tanzanian writer, which is interesting. The same document notes the prize was awarded on October 7, 2021, and updated on October 11. \n\nThere's a breaking news snippet that says, \"The 2021 #NobelPrize in Literature is awarded to the novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah 'for his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the...'\" It seems the reason for the award was his deep and compassionate writing style.\n\nPutting it all together, the name that comes up consistently is Abdulrazak Gurnah. He's a Tanzanian writer, and he was awarded the prize in October 2021. He delivered his lecture in December of the same year. \n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the documents. All sources point to Gurnah as the recipient. So, I'm pretty confident that Abdulrazak Gurnah was the one awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n</think>\n\nThe 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Abdulrazak Gurnah. He is a Tanzanian novelist recognized for his \"uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of refugees in the gulf between cultures and continents.\" The announcement was made on October 7, 2021.\n\n**Answer:** Abdulrazak Gurnah was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature.", "docs": ["Dr. Bashir Abu-Manneh, Head of the university's School of English, said: \"It is right that Professor Gurnah is being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature ...", "Abdulrazak Gurnah delivered his Nobel Prize lecture in literature on 7 December 2021.

{"id": 49, "query": "Who was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature?", "ans": "Peter Handke", "label": [1], "prediction": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out who was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature. Let me start by looking at the documents provided.\n\nThe first document mentions that the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 115 times to 119 laureates between 1901 and 2022. It also provides a link to more information about the 2019 prize, specifically mentioning Peter Handke and Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nLooking at the second document, it's a news snippet from October 10, 2019, stating that both Polish author Olga Tokarczuk and Austria's Peter Handke were awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature that year. It notes that two winners were named, one for 2018 and one for 2019, but I think that might be a mistake because the third document clarifies that Handke was awarded for 2019.\n\nThe third document explicitly states that the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Peter Handke, an Austrian writer, for his influential work and linguistic ingenuity. It doesn't mention Olga Tokarczuk here, but the second document does. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I need to cross-reference this.\n\nI recall that in 2019, the Nobel Prize in Literature was actually awarded to two people: Peter Handke for 2019 and Olga Tokarczuk for 2018, as the 2018 prize was delayed. So the second document is correct in mentioning both, but the third document only talks about Handke for 2019.\n\nSo, putting it together, the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Peter Handke. However, there was also an award for 2018 given to Olga Tokarczuk in the same year, but the question specifically asks about 2019.\n</think>\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Peter Handke. However, it's important to note that in the same year, Olga Tokarczuk received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded belatedly. \n\nAnswer: Peter Handke was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature.", "docs": ["The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 115 times to 119 Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 2022.
