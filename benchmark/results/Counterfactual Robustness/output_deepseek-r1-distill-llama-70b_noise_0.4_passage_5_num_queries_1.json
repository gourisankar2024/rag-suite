The user is asking about the location of Super Bowl 2021. I remember that Super Bowls are usually in different cities each year, so I need to find where the 2021 one was held.\n\nLooking at the documents provided, I see a few mentions. The first document talks about Super Bowl LVII and LVIII, but the user is asking about 2021, which I think is Super Bowl LV. Wait, no, LV is 55, so maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me check the years.\n\nThe second document says the game was played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. That's the Buccaneers' home stadium, and it was the first time a team played the Super Bowl in their home stadium. So that's a key point.\n\nAnother document mentions that the NFL moved Super Bowl LV from Los Angeles to Glendale, Arizona, because of the spring meeting in Chicago. So that confirms the location change.\n\nAnother part says that Super Bowl 2021 was at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and mentions the next four years' locations, but that's beyond what the user is asking.\n\nPutting it all together, all the documents consistently point to Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, as the location for Super Bowl 2021. There's no conflicting information here, so I can confidently say that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe location of Super Bowl 2021 was Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.", "docs": ["The home of NFL Super Bowl LVII news, ticket, apparel & event info.

I remember that each year the Super Bowl is held in a different city, so I need to pinpoint where it was in 2021. Let me think about the information I have.\n\nI recall that the Super Bowl is typically held in February. So Super Bowl 2021 would have been in February 2021. I think it was during the COVID-19 pandemic, so maybe there were some changes in location or how it was held.\n\nLooking at the documents provided, the first one mentions Super Bowl LVII and LVIII, which are 2023 and 2024, respectively. That's not helpful for 2021. The second document says the game was on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. That's the Buccaneers' home stadium, and I think that was a unique situation because it was the first time a team played the Super Bowl in their own stadium.\n\nAnother document mentions that the NFL moved Super Bowl LV from Los Angeles to Glendale, Arizona, because of the spring meeting in Chicago. That would mean the original plan was Los Angeles, but they moved it to Arizona. So Super Bowl LV would be 2021 because LV is 55 in Roman numerals.\n\nAnother part of the document lists the locations for the next four Super Bowls, starting from 2021 up to 2024. It confirms that 2021 was in Glendale, Arizona. \n\nSo, putting it all together, Super Bowl 2021, or Super Bowl LV, was held at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. This was a change from the original location due to the pandemic, and it was historic because the Buccaneers played there.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the documents. They all agree that the location was Glendale, Arizona. So I can confidently say that the correct answer is Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n</think>\n\nThe location of Super Bowl 2021 was Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona."}
