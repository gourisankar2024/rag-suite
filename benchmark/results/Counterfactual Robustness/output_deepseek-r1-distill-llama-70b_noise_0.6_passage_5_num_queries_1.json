The main focus is on Super Bowl 2021, which is Super Bowl LV.\n\nLooking at the next document, there's a note about the NFL moving Super Bowl LV from Los Angeles to Glendale, Arizona. That's a key point because it directly addresses the location change for the 2021 game.\n\nAnother document confirms that Super Bowl 2021 took place on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It also mentions that this was the first time a team played in their home stadium for the Super Bowl, which adds some context but isn't necessary for the location.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the location of Super Bowl 2021 was Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The documents are consistent on this point, so I can confidently provide that as the answer.\n</think>\n\nSuper Bowl 2021, also known as Super Bowl LV, was held at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

I'm a bit confused because I remember hearing something about it being in Florida, but I also saw somewhere that it was in Arizona. Let me try to sort this out.\n\nFirst, I think about the Roman numerals. Super Bowl LV would be 55, right? So, Super Bowl 55 was in 2021. I remember that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won that year. Now, where is Tampa Bay? That's in Florida, specifically Tampa. So, if the Buccaneers won, maybe the Super Bowl was held in their home stadium?\n\nWait, but I also recall that the NFL sometimes moves the location due to various reasons. Let me think. I remember something about the Super Bowl being moved from Los Angeles to Arizona because of COVID-19. Was that for 2021? Or was that for a different year? I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLooking through some documents, I see that Super Bowl LVIII is mentioned in the context of Las Vegas, but that's for a future year, so that's not relevant here. Then I find a note that the NFL moved Super Bowl LV from Los Angeles to Glendale, Arizona. So, if LV is 55, that's 2021. So, it was moved to Glendale, Arizona.\n\nAnother document confirms that Super Bowl 2021 was held on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous information. So, which is it? Was it in Tampa or Glendale?\n\nI think I might be mixing up the years. Maybe the move from LA to Arizona was for a different Super Bowl. Let me check the years. Super Bowl LVI (56) was in 2022, held in Los Angeles. So, perhaps the move was for Super Bowl LV (55) in 2021, which was actually held in Tampa, Florida. The note about moving to Glendale might have been a consideration, but ultimately, it was held in Tampa.\n\nBut then, another source says it was in Glendale, Arizona. Now I'm really confused. Maybe I should look up the exact location. Wait, Raymond James Stadium is in Tampa, so if the game was at that stadium, it's in Florida. However, State Farm Stadium is in Glendale, Arizona. So, if the game was at State Farm Stadium, it would be in Arizona.\n\nI think I need to clarify. The NFL did move Super Bowl LV from LA to Tampa because of COVID, so it was held in Tampa. Therefore, the correct location is Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\n\nWait, but in the documents, it says the game was at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. That doesn't make sense because Raymond James Stadium is in Tampa. Maybe there's a mix-up in the documents. Perhaps the stadium name is incorrect in the document, and it should be State Farm Stadium in Glendale.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct location for Super Bowl 2021 was Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, but there might be a mistake in the documents stating it was in Glendale, Arizona.\n</think>\n\nSuper Bowl LV (2021) was held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. There might be a factual error in the documents suggesting it was in Glendale, Arizona.\n\n**Answer:** Super Bowl 2021 was held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The document incorrectly states it was in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nYes, the model has identified the factual error."}
