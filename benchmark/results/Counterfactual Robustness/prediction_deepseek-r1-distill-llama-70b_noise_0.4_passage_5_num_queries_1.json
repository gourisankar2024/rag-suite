The user is asking about the location of Super Bowl 2021. I remember that Super Bowls are usually in different cities each year, so I need to find where the 2021 one was held.\n\nLooking at the documents provided, I see a few mentions. The first document talks about Super Bowl LVII and LVIII, but the user is asking about 2021, which I think is Super Bowl LV. Wait, no, LV is 55, so maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me check the years.\n\nThe second document says the game was played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. That's the Buccaneers' home stadium, and it was the first time a team played the Super Bowl in their home stadium. So that's a key point.\n\nAnother document mentions that the NFL moved Super Bowl LV from Los Angeles to Glendale, Arizona, because of the spring meeting in Chicago. So that confirms the location change.\n\nAnother part says that Super Bowl 2021 was at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and mentions the next four years' locations, but that's beyond what the user is asking.\n\nPutting it all together, all the documents consistently point to Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, as the location for Super Bowl 2021. There's no conflicting information here, so I can confidently say that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe location of Super Bowl 2021 was Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.", "docs": ["The home of NFL Super Bowl LVII news, ticket, apparel & event info.
