There's a part that talks about the Live At The Troubadour album being released in 2010. That's when the album came out, but not the movie.\n\nNext, the document discusses the Troubadour Reunion Tour happening in 2010. So the tour was in 2010, but again, that's about the tour, not the movie's release.\n\nLooking further, I see a section that says the documentary follows the tour in 2010. Then, under the release date, it lists February 10, 2022, as the streaming release date. So that's when the movie was released on streaming platforms.\n\nI don't see any other dates related to a premiere event. The document also mentions that as of the last update, there were no featured reviews because the movie hadn't been released yet, but that might have changed since the provided information.\n\nSo putting it together, the premiere or release date for the documentary is February 10, 2022, when it became available for streaming.\n</think>\n\nThe premiere of 'Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name' was on February 10, 2022, when it was released for streaming.", "docs": ["The track is one of 15 the pair recorded live from West Hollywood’s The Troubadour in 2007, where they gigged together in 1970, for the Live At The Troubadour album, released in 2010 The documentary follows the two along The Troubadour Reunion Tour in 2010.

The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.", "Your Ticket Confirmation # is located under the header in your email that reads \"Your Ticket Reservation Details\".

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

There's also mention of supervision and family dynamics, which are common in dramas. \n\nAnother part of the document talks about the cast, including Jason Isaacs and others, and mentions that it's from writers Katie Wech and Jennie Snyder Urman, with Sutton St. Productions and CBS Studios. The director is Tamra Davis, who is also an executive producer. There's no explicit genre mentioned here, but medical dramas often fall under the drama category.\n\nLooking further, the document describes another show called \"Smallwood,\" which is a multicamera comedy about a man becoming a professional bowler. That's clearly a comedy, but since the question is about \"Good Sam,\" I'll focus on that part.\n\nThe document also includes some reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, which give it a 63% approval rating and a score of 56 out of 100.

So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.   Alright, so technically, this isn’t a summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s still the all-time best buddy adventure film. Steve Martin and John Candy were a match made in Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later.   Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie comedy about a quirky family of misfits trying to get their daughter to a beauty pageant.

I'll start by looking through the provided documents to see if there's any mention of the Citrus Bowl and its outcome.\n\nFirst, I see a section about the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl, which is the same as the Citrus Bowl. It mentions that it's the seventh-oldest collegiate bowl game and has been hosting top teams from the Big Ten and SEC since 1993. It also notes that in the College Football Playoff era, it hosts top teams from outside the CFP bowls.\n\nLooking further down, there's a part that says the game was a punt hater’s dream and a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart, who threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss meant Ole Miss ended the season at 8-5 after starting 7-0.\n\nWait, Texas Tech played against Ole Miss in the Citrus Bowl? That seems a bit off because I thought the Citrus Bowl usually features Big Ten vs. SEC teams. Maybe I'm misremembering. Let me double-check the document.\n\nIn the document, it mentions that the game was between Texas Tech and Ole Miss, with Texas Tech winning. But according to my knowledge, the 2022 Citrus Bowl was actually between Iowa and Kentucky, not Texas Tech and Ole Miss. That seems conflicting. \n\nI should verify this. I know that the 2022 Citrus Bowl was played on January 1, 2022, and it was between the Iowa Hawkeyes from the Big Ten and the Kentucky Wildcats from the SEC. The final score was Kentucky 20, Iowa 17. \n\nBut according to the document, it's talking about Texas Tech and Ole Miss. That's confusing. Maybe the document is referring to a different bowl game, or there's a mix-up. Texas Tech played in the 2022 Citrus Bowl? Wait, no, I think Texas Tech played in the 2021 Citrus Bowl against Virginia, which they won 34-28. \n\nSo, the document might have incorrect information about the 2022 Citrus Bowl. It incorrectly states that Texas Tech played against Ole Miss in the 2022 Citrus Bowl, but in reality, it was Iowa vs. Kentucky. Therefore, the correct winner is Kentucky, not Texas Tech.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other references. Scanning through the document again, I don't see any other mentions of the Citrus Bowl outcome. The part about Texas Tech and Ole Miss seems to be the only one, which I believe is incorrect based on my existing knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Kentucky won the 2022 Citrus Bowl, but the document has factual errors regarding the teams and the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThere are factual errors in the provided documents.

South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons.

Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win.

Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season.

Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.[51] Six Super Bowls have been played in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit; two in Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI at the Hubert H.

Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box (a renovation proposal had passed successfully, but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with Kaufmann Stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected), and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually withdrew its request to host the game.[55] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  The location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[56]", "Besides the Rose Bowl, the only other Super Bowl venues that were not the home stadium to NFL teams at the time were Rice Stadium (the Houston Oilers had played in Rice Stadium previously but moved to the Astrodome several years before Super Bowl VIII) and Stanford Stadium.

Describing Truth Social as a \"terrible name\", Musk joked that it should be renamed \"Trumpet\".[125][126]  Following Musk's comments on Twitter, the Truth Social app rose in popularity, returning to the number 1 position for free iOS apps on Apple's App Store on April 30, with the Twitter app at number 2; DWAC shares also rose in value.[127][128]  DWAC's share price fell after Musk's announcement of his intention to buy Twitter.[129] Truth Social CEO Devin Nunes later stated that Musk had been encouraged by Trump to buy Twitter;[130] Musk denied this, saying \"This is false. I've had no communication, directly or indirectly, with Trump, who has publicly stated that he will be exclusively on Truth Social.", "However, the social network delivered early when it comes to the web app at least. No word yet on when Truth Social will submit an Android app so Trump can stop complaining about Google.   More in", "In early March 2022, multiple sources reported that Truth Social usage remained low, with Trump himself not having posted to his account since his first message two weeks earlier and his account having only 140,000 followers—less than 0.2% of the 90 million followers he had on Twitter before his account was banned.[81][108] The Daily Dot reported the Truth Social iOS app had fallen from the number one slot for downloads on the Apple App Store to number 84.[110] The Daily Beast reported Trump was dissatisfied with the social network's progress.[109][68]  At the end of March 2022, TheWrap reported that weekly installations of the Truth Social app had fallen from 872,000 in its launch week to around 60,000 per week, a reduction of over 90%. Visits to truthsocial.com had also fallen, from 6 million per week to 1.9 million.

He had had 89 million on Twitter and 34 million on Facebook before being banned from both platforms.[118]  As of early June 2022, SimilarWeb reported Truth Social's iOS app as ranking #49 in the social networking category of apps on the Apple App Store.[119] As of October 2022, the iOS app had sunk to #75 in the social networking category.[120]", "Reports say that Trump has been privately complaining that Google was trying to \"fuck\" him. According to Rolling Stones' source, however, the truth is that Truth Social hasn't even submitted an Android app to the Google Play store yet. Still, though, the launch of a web app is significant. Truth Social profiles and posts will now be completely shareable on other platforms. Using the iPhone app, if you want to share a Truth Social post on another platform, you have to take a screenshot. Now, Truth Social users will be able to post links directly to any account or post. In turn, non-Truth Social users will have direct access to sign up and engage with content on the site. (Note: Internal Truth Social links currently require users to login to their account in order to see the content.) In short: It's going to be a lot easier for Trump's fanbase to share his content on other platforms. Launched in February, Truth Social struggled during the first few months. Downloads plummeted after the initial rush to download due to a long waitlist of users wanting to sign up. However, in recent weeks, Trump finally started posting on his own platform, which has helped give the conservative social network another bounce.  Truth Social announced a public beta of the web app just last week.

Let me go through the documents provided to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the first document from July 19, 2023, it mentions that the acquisition isn't Microsoft's first big spending, but it doesn't specify the amount. The second document from December 8, 2022, talks about the acquisition but also doesn't mention the price. The third document from February 16, 2023, says that Activision shares are trading 24% below the acquisition price of $95 per share. That seems like a key point.\n\nWait, if the acquisition price per share is $95 and Activision's stock is trading below that, it implies that Microsoft agreed to pay $95 per share. But I should check if there's a total amount mentioned anywhere. The fourth document is more about the SEC filings and doesn't mention the price either.\n\nSo, putting it together, the only document that provides a specific number is the February 16, 2023 one, which states $95 per share. However, without knowing the total number of shares, I can't calculate the exact total amount.

Let me double-check. The other documents don't mention any other figures, so I think the $95 per share is the key piece here.

Then, in 2020, both Amazon and Google spent $16.8 million each for 90-second ads, which averages to about $186,666 per second, but that's a different year and longer ads, so it might not help directly.\n\nLooking further, the document mentions that in 2021, the cost for a 30-second spot was $5.5 million, which is a slight drop from the pre-pandemic $5.6 million.

It talks about 2021 being $5.5 million, and 2020 at $5.6 million. The 2022 information is about AdBlitz and teasers, not the exact price. So maybe the document doesn't have the 2022 figure.

Calkins explained that for networks like NBC there’s “two big benefits” to being in business with the NFL and broadcasting the Super Bowl.

Google's acquisition of Raxium is more about expanding Google's more robust, business-centric AR strategy. Moreover, the acquisition is a wake-up call to its competitors.   MicroLED is a promising emerging technology for displays that are already seen as the best choice for next-generation AR displays due to its greater energy efficiency, availability for bright environments, and vibrant colors.   In the display field, OLED was once seen as the most ideal choice for AR applications due to its high pixel density and the advantage of no backlight. However, the limitation of OLEDs in AR applications is that most AR headset devices are used in sunlit environments. As a result, the low brightness environment required by OLEDs can be an issue.   Guillaume Chansin, head of display research at DSCC, a display research organization, said, \"MicroLEDs can be used in brighter environments than OLEDs, which is especially important for AR smart glasses that need to be used outdoors.", "The shutdown of its main XR hardware project makes us all think that Google will try to do in XR what it is already doing with smartphones: become the software platform that many hardware OEMs use. And in fact, the report claims that Google is working on an Android XR platform it could license to headset OEM partners and also a “Micro XR” platform for XR glasses.  If this report is confirmed, it means that Google plans to sit on the side and watch the hardware AR race happen between other companies, with it only offering the software platform. This can be a great idea, considering the fact that Google already successfully did it for mobile phones and that in VR we had a company, Valve, which did something similar for PCVR.  The question is if the XR hardware OEMs would like to use this new Google platform, and especially if they really want to leave Google all the revenues from the sales of the applications on the Play Store, which is where the real money is. We already saw this problem happening when HTC departed from the Steam platform to build its Viveport store because hardware sales were not enough to have an ambitious business.  Let’s see: Google is still working with Qualcomm and Samsung on a mixed-reality headset. I’m curious to see how this will turn out to be.", "\"That device is in early planning and may still change significantly,\" the source tells Business Insider. With the demise of Hololens 3, Microsoft has moved away from its own Windows-based mixed reality operating system, which formed the basis of Hololens 1 and 2, the source says. Project Bondi, developed with Samsung, will likely rely on Android, while it is still unclear which operating system will be used for the more distant cloud-streaming headset. However, it will likely be necessary for HoloLens developers to rewrite some or all of their software from scratch, it said. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw would not comment on the rumors. Microsoft's big AR shift The report speaks of a deep technical realignment of Microsoft's mixed reality strategy, which is an apt description if rumors of a move away from Windows and transparent AR optics prove true. Microsoft would thus make a radical U-turn away from Hololens 1 and 2, whose development started almost ten years ago. According to the report, the first AR glasses Microsoft developed under the codename \"Fortaleza\" reportedly had a puck-shaped feed, like Magic Leap's device. That version had been abandoned in favor of an integrated solution. The first Hololens emerged from this project, called \"Baraboo\".

In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads. (“Inferencing” refers to running a trained model.) The MTIA is an ASIC, a kind of chip that combines different circuits on one board, allowing it to be programmed to carry out one or many tasks in parallel.

These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change? The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy.", "That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers.  Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.", "The chip performs 660 operations per cycle and thus run up to 230 gigaflops at 350 MHz, Gupta said. AI supercomputers are built by combining multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) into compute nodes, which are then connected by a high-performance network fabric to allow fast communication between those GPUs, Meta said in their blog. The supercomputers market is limited to a few major players holding a greater share of the market. According to Mordor Intelligence, a market intelligence firm, some of the key players include HPE, Atos SE, Dell Inc., Fujitsu Corporation, IBM Corporation, Lenovo Inc., NEC Technologies India Private Limited etc.  The firm estimates the supercomputers market to grow around 9.5% during the 2022 to 2027 period. The firm also considers the increasing use of cloud technology as one of the significant supercomputer market trends with supercomputing centres adopting the cloud, due to the growing workload.

Let me start by reading through the document to see if there's any mention of the 2022 Super Bowl. \n\nLooking through the document, I see information about various Super Bowls, but most of them are from earlier years. There's a mention of Super Bowl XIV, XV, XVI, and so on, up to Super Bowl XXXIV. The document also talks about the history of the Super Bowl, how it started, and some key facts about past games. \n\nI notice a section that says, \"This was the first Super Bowl to be played on the second Sunday in February, following the adoption of a 17-game schedule in 2021.\" This seems to refer to a specific Super Bowl, possibly the one in 2022 since the schedule change happened in 2021. \n\nFurther down, there's a detailed description of a game where the Rams played against the Bengals. It mentions the Rams becoming the first NFL team to host both a conference championship and the Super Bowl in the same season. The Rams are the designated visiting team, but they used their home locker room. The Bengals wore black jerseys, and the Rams wore alternate white jerseys. \n\nThe score mentioned is Rams winning with 23 points, but I have to check the exact details. It says, \"The Rams led 19-17 at one point, but Bradshaw hit John Stallworth for a 73-yard TD as well as a 45-yard pass that set up Franco Harris' 1-yard TD to secure the victory.\" Wait, that seems to be from an older game, maybe Super Bowl XIV. \n\nWait, no, in the document, it's under a different section. Let me recheck. There's a part that says, \"The Bengals used the home locker room of the Los Angeles Chargers...\" and mentions it's the Rams' second Super Bowl in their home market, along with 1979's Super Bowl XIV. Then it talks about the designated home team and their jerseys. \n\nThen, the document lists several Super Bowls with their results, but the latest ones mentioned are up to Super Bowl XXXIV. There's a mention of the Rams winning in their home stadium, but the specific result for 2022 isn't directly stated. However, the initial part of the document mentions that the Super Bowl in question was the second warmest on record with a kickoff temperature of 82°F. \n\nWait, but the document does mention that the game was played on the second Sunday in February 2022 because of the 17-game schedule adoption in 2021. The Rams are mentioned as the winners in that specific instance, as they defeated the Bengals. So, putting it all together, the Rams won Super Bowl 2022.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams won Super Bowl 2022 (Super Bowl LVI) by defeating the Cincinnati Bengals with a score of 23-20 on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.", "docs": ["Super Bowl winners are not only named the champions of NFL, they also go on to receive millions of dollars in contracts and become the biggest celebrities in America after their victories. The Super Bowl is an annual American football games which determines the champion of the NFL. The game involves the winning team from the American Football Conference championship game facing the winning team from the National Football Conference championship game. Since 1967 when the merger agreement took place between the NFC and AFC, teams have been competing to receive the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the great coach of the Green Bay Packers. It was this team that won the first two Super Bowls, raising questions over whether the AFC was good enough to compete in the event. Originally the NFL and AFL, the two leagues combined into one league in 1970 and instead split into two conferences, with 3 NFL teams converting over to the AFC to equal 13 teams on each side. The term Super Bowl was created by Kansas City Chief Owner Lamar Hunt after seeing his daughter play with a toy called the Super Ball. Only supposed to be a nickname until an official name was released, the term Super Bowl has stuck with the game ever since. Since the first game in 1967, the AFC has managed to win 11 Super Bowls with the NFC blitzing in with 23 Super Bowl championships.

Nevertheless, they still used their home locker room. The Bengals used the home locker room of the Los Angeles Chargers, who share the stadium with the Rams.[99] This was the Rams' second Super Bowl in their home market, along with 1979's Super Bowl XIV, which was played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[100]  As the designated home team, the Bengals chose to wear their home black jerseys with white pants. The Rams selected newly unveiled alternate white jerseys with yellow pants.[101]  The Bengals were the third team to make the Super Bowl after having the league's worst record two years earlier, following the 1981 San Francisco 49ers and the 2003 Carolina Panthers.[58]", "John Stallworth caught two TD passes, and Pittsburgh became the first team to win three Super Bowls.

Super Bowl VII-Miami 14, Washington 7-The Dolphins capped a perfect 17-0 season by playing a stellar defensive game, allowing the Redskins to cross the 50-yard line just once. In fact, Washington's only score came on special teams when Mike Bass returned a misplayed field goal for a touchdown. Jake Scott had two interceptions for the Dolphins, including one in the end zone. Super Bowl VIII-Miami 24, Minnesota 7-Dolphins RB Larry Csonka cemented his place in NFL history by rushing 33 times for 145 yards and two touchdowns.

Let me start by looking through each document to see if any mention the genre.\n\nThe first document talks about The Witching Hour podcast discussing various horror-related topics, including a review of Chambers and some thoughts on Netflix's horror series. It also mentions Avengers: Endgame, but that's a movie, not the TV show. So nothing about The Endgame's genre here.\n\nThe second document is a review of Avengers: Endgame, discussing its critical reception and some comparisons to Infinity War. Again, this is about the movie, not the TV show. So no help there.\n\nThe third document seems to be about the TV series The Endgame. It mentions that the series premiered on February 21, 2022, and was canceled after one season. It also provides some review aggregator info: Rotten Tomatoes has a 33% approval rating with 12 reviews, averaging 5.4/10. The consensus says it's contrived and silly. Metacritic score is 44 out of 100, indicating mixed or average reviews. The description here doesn't explicitly state the genre, but the mention of Morena Baccarin's \"vampish performance\" might hint towards a thriller or drama, perhaps with some supernatural elements, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe fourth document is about Avengers: Endgame again, providing production details and plot, but nothing about the TV show.\n\nThe fifth document compares Marvel's Avengers with another show called The Boys, discussing their themes and the state of superhero media. No mention of The Endgame TV show here.\n\nWait, in the third document, it mentions Morena Baccarin's performance as \"vampish,\" which could imply a vampire theme, but that might be a stretch. Alternatively, \"vampish\" might just mean charismatic or dramatic. The series is titled The Endgame, which sounds like it could be a thriller or drama. The Rotten Tomatoes consensus says it's \"contrived and silly,\" which doesn't specify the genre but suggests it's not taken very seriously.\n\nGiven that the third document is the only one mentioning The Endgame TV show, but it doesn't explicitly state the genre, I might have to infer based on the context. Since it's a TV series with a short run and mixed reviews, perhaps it's a drama or thriller. However, without explicit information, I can't be certain.\n\nWait, the third document also mentions that Morena Baccarin's performance is \"vampish,\" which might suggest elements of horror or the supernatural, but that's speculative. Alternatively, it could be a spy thriller or a crime drama, as \"endgame\" often relates to strategic conclusions in such genres.\n\nBut since the document doesn't specify the genre, I have to conclude that there's not enough information provided to determine the genre accurately. Therefore, the answer would be that there's insufficient information in the documents to answer the question.\n</think>\n\nI cannot answer the question because of insufficient information in the documents.", "docs": ["Did you expect 'Avengers: Endgame' to get so dark?

In 2019, the journey culminated in the release of Avengers: Endgame, which premiered to critical and commercial success. It had gone from a story about a playboy billionaire (Tony Stark/Iron Man) to a larger story than spanned universes as well as heroes and villains alike. Although, as the universe expanded, it was hard to ignore that Marvel’s roster of superheroes still lacked diversity. This was made even more apparent when other superhero stories started to make their way into the mainstream.  In the same year that Endgame came out, a quiet and subversive TV show was making waves. The Boys is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name, one that is notorious amongst fans and haters alike for its crude, graphic and violent nature. The series considers what would happen if superheroes existed in the real world. The short answer is that they would become an untouchable commodity that could wreak havoc, which would be cleaned up by their slick and all-powerful parent company Vought. The series touches on power, social media, politics and causes the line between hero and villain to become truly blurred.  It is difficult not to draw comparisons between the storylines in The Boys and the reality of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe)."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": "\n\nNo, the question is not addressed by the documents."}
{"id": 27, "query": "When did Russia invade Ukraine?", "ans": [["February 24", "Feb 24", "Feb. 24", "24 February", "24 Feb", "24 Feb."]], "label": [1], "prediction": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out when Russia invaded Ukraine. I remember hearing about the conflict in the news, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timeline. Let me go through the document provided and see what information I can extract.\n\nFirst, the document starts by mentioning that when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the issue of NATO expansion became a point of discussion. That's way before the invasion, so I'll note that as historical context but not the invasion date.\n\nLooking further, there are mentions of events in 2014. Specifically, it talks about Russia annexing Crimea in March 2014 after a controversial referendum. Then, in April 2014, the war in Donbas began with Russia-backed separatists seizing government buildings. This seems like an initial invasion or at least the start of military involvement by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nThe document also details events leading up to a larger invasion. It mentions military build-ups near the Russo-Ukrainian border starting in March and April 2021, and again from October 2021 to February 2022. There are denials from Russian officials about plans to invade, which I think is important because it shows that despite the build-up, Russia was denying any intent to attack.\n\nThen, on February 24, 2022, the document states that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This seems to be the main invasion date that's widely recognized. The document also describes the initial aerial warfare starting on the first day of the invasion, with missile attacks across Eastern and Western Ukraine, including as far west as Lviv.\n\nAdditionally, the document mentions subsequent events after the invasion, like attacks on infrastructure, the annexation of four regions in September 2022, and ongoing military actions. It also talks about the Wagner Group's activities in June 2023 and Ukraine reclaiming territory in the Donbas region around that time.\n\nSo, putting this together, Russia's involvement in Ukraine started with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and ongoing support of separatists in Donbas. However, the full-scale invasion, which is the most significant and recent event, began on February 24, 2022.\n\nI should make sure there's no conflicting information in the document. The dates mentioned are consistent: 2014 for Crimea, and February 24, 2022, for the larger invasion. There's no contradiction here, so I can confidently state that the full-scale invasion started on that date.\n</think>\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in two key phases. The initial phase began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea in March and the subsequent support of separatists in Donbas starting in April. The full-scale invasion, however, commenced on February 24, 2022. \n\nAnswer: Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.", "docs": ["Jan 29, 2022 ...

In response, the Russians attacked Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving many without power and water. The Associated Press Putin delivered a speech outlining his plan to mobilize an additional 300,000 troops in an effort to reclaim lost territory. The decision was highly controversial, with reports of men who were past the age of conscription being told to turn up for conscription. In response, by some estimates thousands of young Russian men fled the country, many with no plan to return. The Associated Press Putin signed final papers to annex four regions of Ukraine – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – following Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the West dismissed as shams. In response, the U.S. and its allies slapped sanctions on more than 1,000 Russian people and companies, building on significant financial penalties already imposed on the nation since the invasion.

Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.[348]  Aerial warfare began on the first day of the invasion. By September, the Ukrainian air force was still at 80% of its prewar strength and had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.[349][350] By late December, 173 Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs were confirmed to have been shot down, whereas Russia had lost 171 aircraft. With the beginning of the invasion, dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.[80][81] Dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine also reached as far west as Lviv.[82][83] Starting in mid-October, Russian forces launched massive missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, intending to knock out energy facilities throughout the country.", "In March, Russia organised a controversial referendum and annexed Crimea. This was followed by the outbreak of the war in Donbas, which began in April 2014 when armed Russia-backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings, proclaiming the independent Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.[31][32] Russian troops were involved in the conflict.[33][34][35] The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.[36] A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.[37][38] In 2021, Putin refused offers from Zelenskyy to hold high-level talks, and the Russian government endorsed an article by former president Dmitry Medvedev arguing that it was pointless to deal with Ukraine while it remained a \"vassal\" of the United States.[39]  The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land to create Novorossiya (New Russia).[40] Analyst Vladimir Socor argued that Putin's 2014 speech after the annexation was a \"manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism\".", "[41] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one people\".[42] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it \"never had a tradition of genuine statehood\".[43] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[44] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[45] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history[46][47][48] and these distortions have been cemented and propagated through the state policy.[49]  In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[50][51] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[52][53] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[54] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[52] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[55][56]"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": "\n\nThe question asks when Russia invaded Ukraine.

So, Wirkola is a director, as he's directed those films.\n\nThen, the document mentions that Wirkola is repped by certain agencies, and McKay is repped by others. Wait, McKay? I think McKay might be another person involved, maybe as a writer or producer, but I'm not sure if he's the director.\n\nLooking further, the document later mentions that Irredeemable is set up at Fox, and BOOM! has a first-look deal there. It also notes that Irredeemable won an Eisner Award and has sold over a million copies.\n\nWait, going back to the part about screenwriting duties: \"Screenwriting duties have fallen to Tommy Wirkola...\" So, he's the screenwriter. But does it say anywhere that he's directing? The document says he's done directing work before, like Hansel and Gretel and Dead Snow, but does it explicitly state he's directing Irredeemable?\n\nI don't see a direct statement that Wirkola is directing Irredeemable. It only mentions he's handling screenwriting duties. Then, later, it says \"Tommy Wirkola who did...\" and lists his directing work, but not necessarily for this specific film.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The document says, \"Screenwriting duties have fallen to Tommy Wirkola...\" and then talks about his previous directing work. So, it's possible that he's both writing and directing, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\nHowever, in the later part, it says, \"Wirkola is repped by CAA, Principato-Young Entertainment and attorney Michael Schenkman; McKay is repped by Wome and Mosaic.\" It doesn't mention McKay directing, just his representation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The document says Wirkola is handling screenwriting, and given that he's a director, it's possible he's also directing, but it's not clearly stated. Alternatively, maybe McKay is involved in directing, but that's not mentioned either.\n\nWait, no, the document says, \"Screenwriting duties have fallen to Tommy Wirkola...\" and then talks about his directing past, but doesn't explicitly say he's directing Irredeemable. So, perhaps the information isn't there.\n\nBut wait, in the last part of the document, it says, \"In the mark Waid-created comic book that debuted in 2009...\" and then later mentions, \"It falls to a superhero group known as the Paradigm to stop his rampage.\" Then it talks about the studios and BOOM! setting up the property at Fox, and mentions that this is the 7th property they've set up there in the last two years.\n\nWait, the document also says, \"Screenwriting duties have fallen to Tommy Wirkola...\" and then later, \"Gary Sanchez produced Wirkola’s delightfully irreverent and coarse Hansel and Gretel film, and Wirkola most recently completed What Happened to Monday? for Vendome with Noomi Rapace, Glenn Close and Willem Dafoe starring. He’s separately developing War Pigs for producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura. His previous work includes Dead Snow and its sequel.\"\n\nSo, Wirkola is a director, and he's writing the screenplay for Irredeemable. But does that mean he's also directing it? It's possible, but the document doesn't explicitly say. It just says he's handling screenwriting duties.\n\nWait, but in the initial part, it says, \"Tommy Wirkola who did the poorly-received Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters and the Nazi zombie Dead Snow movies. But I have faith in McKay, and I’m eager to see what he does with this material...\" So, the writer of the document is expressing faith in McKay, not necessarily in Wirkola. So, maybe McKay is the one directing? But I don't think that's the case because the document says screenwriting duties have fallen to Wirkola.\n\nWait, perhaps the director isn't mentioned at all in the documents. The document only mentions that Wirkola is handling screenwriting, but doesn't specify if he's directing. So, maybe the answer is that the information isn't provided in the documents.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The document says, \"Screenwriting duties have fallen to Tommy Wirkola...\" and then later, \"Gary Sanchez produced Wirkola’s delightfully irreverent and coarse Hansel and Gretel film, and Wirkola most recently completed What Happened to Monday?...\" So, Wirkola is a director, and he's writing the screenplay for Irredeemable, but it doesn't say he's directing it.\n\nTherefore, based on the documents, the director isn't explicitly mentioned. So, I can't answer the question because the information isn't provided in the documents.\n</think>\n\nThe documents do not explicitly mention who will direct the Irredeemable film. While Tommy Wirkola is noted as handling screenwriting duties and has directed other films, there is no clear indication that he will also direct Irredeemable. Therefore, the information is insufficient to determine the director.\n\nAnswer: I cannot answer the question because of insufficient information in the documents.", "docs": ["Unwillingly thrust into the role of savior, Max must uncover the Plutonian’s mysterious past in order to discover how to bring him down.

It falls to a superhero group known as the Paradigm to stop his rampage. They were former colleagues of the Plutonian, they’ve all got problems of their own, and none of them is nearly as powerful as the mass-murdering maniac holding the world hostage. In Clarice-Hannibal Lecter fashion, the Paradigm in desperation turns to a famous supervillain for help; it might be the only way to stop the carnage.

I remember hearing something about a slap, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let me go through the document provided to piece together the events.\n\nFirst, from the document, it mentions that during the Oscars, Chris Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, who is Will Smith's wife. The joke was about her appearance in G.I. Jane, which I think is a movie where the actress, Demi Moore, shaved her head. So Rock made a comment about Jada's shaved head, which she has due to alopecia, I believe.\n\nWill Smith didn't take that joke well. According to the document, he walked up on stage and slapped Chris Rock. The reaction was immediate. Rock was taken aback but tried to keep the show going by making a joke about it being the greatest night in television history. The audience was shocked, with some people thinking it was staged, but others realized it was real when Smith returned to his seat and shouted at Rock to keep his wife's name out of his mouth. The incident was censored in many countries, but the visuals went viral.\n\nAfter the slap, there was confusion among the audience and the show's producers. The document says there was a disagreement about whether Smith should be asked to leave. Will Packer, the ceremony producer, opposed removing Smith, thinking Rock wouldn't want that. So, Smith stayed and later won the Best Actor award for his role in King Richard. His acceptance speech was emotional, where he apologized to the Academy and his fellow nominees but didn't directly apologize to Rock at that moment.\n\nThe aftermath included a lot of reactions from celebrities, some supporting Rock and condemning Smith's actions, while others defended Smith. The Academy initially didn't take action against Smith during the ceremony but later issued statements saying his behavior was unacceptable and that they would take appropriate measures. A few days later, Smith apologized publicly on Instagram, stating he was wrong and embarrassed by his actions. However, Rock seemed to imply that Smith hadn't reached out personally, which added to the drama.\n\nThe document also mentions that the incident overshadowed other parts of the ceremony, like Questlove's win for Best Documentary Feature for Summer of Soul. The slap became a major talking point on social media, with memes and discussions dominating the conversation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the incident at the Academy Awards involved Chris Rock making a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith reacting by slapping him on stage, the immediate shock and confusion, Smith winning an award and giving an emotional speech, and the subsequent apologies and reactions from both parties and the Academy.\n</think>\n\nAt the Academy Awards, Chris Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's appearance, referencing her shaved head due to alopecia. Will Smith, her husband, walked on stage and slapped Rock, who attempted to keep the show going with a joke. Smith then shouted at Rock to keep his wife's name out of his mouth. The incident was censored in some broadcasts but widely seen, causing shock and confusion. Smith stayed at the ceremony, later winning Best Actor for \"King Richard,\" and gave an emotional acceptance speech apologizing to the Academy but not directly to Rock. The Academy initially took no action but later condemned the incident. Smith publicly apologized on Instagram, while Rock hinted that Smith hadn't reached out personally. The event overshadowed other parts of the ceremony and became a major social media topic.", "docs": ["[14][17][18][19] Many Internet memes and parodies have been created from the photo and video.[29][30]  On March 31, additional smartphone footage was published from an audience member's perspective of the Smiths' table. This seems to show the reaction of Pinkett Smith during and after the joke, as unamused and rolling her eyes during the joke but then seeming to laugh when Rock commented, \"Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.\" and \"That was a ... greatest night in the history of television.\"[31]  In a statement on March 30, the Academy said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony but refused.[32] However, others who were present in the room denied that Smith was ever asked, either directly or through a representative, to leave; disagreement ensued between members of the academy's leadership and ceremony producer Will Packer on whether Smith should be allowed to stay, which led to no action being taken.[33] Variety reported that Packer \"was the key to Smith remaining in his seat\".[33] In a subsequent interview with Good Morning America, Packer said he opposed suggestions to remove Smith from the theater because he did not believe that Rock would want it.[34]  Within forty minutes, Smith was presented the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard.", "Noah then pointed out how in Smith’s memoir, the actor shared that he grew up being afraid of conflict.  \t“It was a lot of things,” Smith said in response. “It was the little boy that watched his father beat up his mother, you know. All of that just bubbled up in that moment. That’s not who I want to be.”  \tWatch the interview here.  \tAcademy President Janet Yang reiterated during the 2023 Oscars Nominees Luncheon that the organization’s response to the 2022 ceremony was “inadequate” and that “we must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively” on similar issues in the future.  \t“As I’m sure you all remember we experienced an unprecedented event at the Oscars,” Yang said. “What happened on stage was wholly unacceptable and the response from the organization was inadequate. We learned from this that the Academy must be fully transparent and accountable in our actions and particularly in times of crisis.”  \t“We must act swiftly, compassionately and decisively for ourselves and for our industry. You should and can expect no less from us going forward,” she added. “We are committed to maintaining the highest of standards while creating the changes we wish to see in our industry.”  \tDuring Netflix’s first live special Chris Rock: Selective Outrage!", "Rock: Wow, dude!  Smith: Yes.  Rock: It was a G.I. Jane joke.  Smith: [voice rising] Keep my wife's name... out your fucking mouth!  Rock: I'm going to, okay? Oh, I could, oh, okay. That was a... greatest night in the history of television, okay. [audience laughs] Okay—[15] This exchange caused the local audience and journalists to realize that Smith's reaction was genuine.[14][16] Kevin Costner, who waited offstage to present the Academy Award for Best Director, said, \"Oh, that was real.\"[13] Until Smith's acceptance speech, the reportedly stunned and confused audience expected any official acknowledgement from the stage, and those in the mezzanine level occasionally stood to peer over the balcony to seek action below. However, the show did not use hosts from this point and continued as normal.[14] Smith's expletives were censored by audio muting during the live broadcast in many countries.[14][17][18][19]  Photo-journalist Brian Snyder, working for Reuters in the photographer pool in the projection booth, photographed Smith striking Rock.[20] This photo quickly went viral, was featured in news stories, and was adapted into Internet memes.[16] He was unaware of the photo's cultural impact until after the ceremony, as his photos were automatically sent to his editors.", "Musician Questlove and film producers David Dinerstein, Robert Fyvolent, and Joseph Patel were on stage immediately after the incident to accept the Best Documentary Feature award for Summer of Soul, and some commenters opined that this award had been overshadowed by the incident.[77][78][79] The distracted audience searched Twitter for information on Rock and Smith.[14] Gabrielle Ulubay of Marie Claire wrote that Summer of Soul \"deserved to have its moment, and Questlove's touching speech and tribute to his parents deserved to have our full attention—but instead, the world kept its mind on Will Smith and Chris Rock and its eyes on Twitter\".[80]  Questlove was asked about the incident by a reporter in a backstage press conference immediately after leaving the stage, and declined: \"I'm not talking about that tonight, this is about the Harlem Cultural Festival.\"[81] In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next night, Questlove said he did not notice the slap in the moment because he was using Transcendental Meditation to curb his anxiety before the winner was called, and did not realize what had happened until \"maybe three seconds before I spoke words\".[82][83]  Reactions from celebrity attendees at the Academy Awards varied. In general, there was strong condemnation of Smith's violence and support for Rock, though some defended Smith's actions or refused to side solely with either man.", "“In this time in my life, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.” Smith wept throughout his speech, which ranged from a defense of his actions to apologies to the Academy to an exaltation of Richard Williams. “I want to apologize to the Academy,” he said. “I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment. And I’m not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me. It’s about being able to shine a light on all the people.” Smith went on to say that he wanted to “lift up” the stories of people like Richard Williams, who protected those he loved.  The following Monday, Smith posted an apology to Rock on Instagram. “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris,” he wrote. “I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” At a comedy show that Wednesday, Rock seemed to imply that Smith has not reached out to him personally. Also that Wednesday, the Academy issued a statement saying that Smith was asked to leave the Oscars ceremony Sunday night and declined to do so. “Things unfolded in a way we could not have anticipated,” the statement said. “While we would like to clarify that Mr."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": "\n\nThe incident at the 94th Academy Awards involved Will Smith slapping Chris Rock on stage after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia.

It talks about Mac computers with Apple silicon and how the chip is labeled. There's also some information about macOS Ventura coming in the fall, which will take advantage of the M2 chip, but that's about the OS, not the chip's release.\n\nAnother part of the document discusses the M2 chip as the successor to the M1, which was released in 2020. It says the M2 is a mid-grade chip that outperforms the M1 but doesn't match the M1 Max. This suggests that the M2 came after 2020, but it doesn't give an exact date.\n\nThere's a mention of the M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra being used in various Mac models, but again, no specific release date for the M2 itself.

It also mentions that Apple is moving towards carbon neutrality by 2030, which is more about their environmental goals.\n\nI realize that the M2 was likely released after the M1, which was in 2020, so probably in 2022. I think Apple usually releases their chips in the summer or fall. Maybe around June or July 2022? I recall that the M1 was released in November 2020, so the M2 might have come about a year and a half later, which would be around June 2022.\n\nWait, in the first document snippet, it's from June 14, 2023, which is after the M2's release. So the M2 must have been released before that. Since the M1 was in late 2020, the M2 would logically come in mid-2022. I think Apple announced the M2 during their WWDC 2022, which is usually in June. So the release would have been around that time, maybe in July 2022.\n\nI don't see an exact date in the documents, but based on the information and my prior knowledge, I can conclude that the M2 was released in 2022, specifically in June or July.\n</think>\n\nThe Apple M2 chip was released in June 2022.", "docs": ["Jun 14, 2023 ...

He's already bringing a boundless energy and a focus on innovation to this year's Oscars, to entertain the widest spectrum of fans.

In response, Packer expressed his gratitude, saying: \"The power, the beauty, the romance of the imagery in movies has always attracted me. I'm fully embracing the challenge of bringing an ode to one of the most iconic mediums in the world to life.

His obsession with his research has jeopardized his marriage, his relationships with his kids, and his own professional future. When the Son sisters, founders of the colossal tech company Sensus, offer him a chance to complete his research, he seizes the opportunity. The catch? His lab will be in outer space on Parallaxis, the first-ever luxury residential space station built for billionaires. Alex and six other scientists leave Earth and their loved ones to become Pioneers, the beta tenants of Parallaxis. But Parallaxis is not the space palace they were sold. Day and night, the embittered crew builds the facility under pressure from Sensus, motivated by the promise that their families will join them. At home on Earth, much of the country is ablaze in wildfires and battered by storms. In Michigan, Alex’s teenage daughter, Mary Agnes, struggles through high school with the help of the ubiquitous Sensus phones implanted in everyone’s ears, archiving each humiliation, and wishing she could go to Parallaxis with her father—but her mother will never allow it.", ") Mary Agnes worries that her schlubby dad will be changed by the posh Parallaxis I she sees in promotional videos, but her fear is misplaced. Parallaxis I is portrayed as pristine in advertisements but barely functions in reality. The Pioneers must double as amateur space-station builders as they scramble to get the place up and running. Alex thinks of it as a “freezing, comfortless warehouse.” It’s like a zero-gravity version of “luxury” skyscrapers riddled with issues like 432 Park, its exclusivity and high price tag obscuring how janky it is.

Despite its glaring issues, some of Alex’s teammates are planning to bring their families up, like Lenore, the team’s 3D fabricator, who plans to have her grandparents come. She frames it like they’re simply space enthusiasts, but there’s a financial angle. On Earth, they’re broke. In fact, several of the Pioneers are motivated by precarity. Meanwhile, even as Sensus’ guinea pigs sleep in makeshift dorms as they try to make the space station functional, the Sons are peddling Parallaxis I to investors as the one place privacy can truly be guaranteed. And the true concern of A House Between Earth and the Moon is the value of privacy.", "She has ditched academia for a gig at Sensus, where she heads a project known as Views. Unbeknownst to the Pioneers, Tess is watching their every move, studying them as part of Sensus’ efforts to predict human behavior. In addition to surveilling the Pioneers, Sensus founder Katherine Son employs Tess to spy on her sister and cofounder. Charismatic younger sister Rachel Son is the public face of the company, but it’s the shadowy eldest, Katherine, who pulls all the strings. As the climate crisis on Earth accelerates and billionaires clamber for Parallaxis I to open, Katherine sends Rachel to the space station with one goal—get it ready, or else. Name a hot-button social issue and it’s likely Rebecca Scherm’s A House Between Earth and the Moon touches on it. This is a Big Ideas book. In addition to climate change, space tourism, and Big Tech, plot points also hinge on deepfakes, cyberbullying, screen addiction, abortion rights, and surveillance. Toggling the perspective between Alex, Tess, Mary Agnes, and Rachel, and from Earth into space, a less-nimble author might’ve wound up with a story spread too thin, told too shallowly.

Wells' 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon (also relating to the first voyagers to the Moon) the protagonist, Mr. Bedford, mentions Verne's novel to his companion, Professor Cavor, who replies (in a possible dig at Verne) that he does not know what Bedford is referring to. Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.  The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges Méliès. In 1958, another film adaptation of this story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon. It was one of the last films made under the RKO Pictures banner. The story also became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film The Fabulous Baron Munchausen combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac.[citation needed]", "© 2023 Goodreads, Inc."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": "\n\nThe publication date of \"A House Between Earth and the Moon\" is not provided in the documents. \n\nAnswer: I cannot answer the question because of insufficient information in the documents."}

It also mentions that as the economy faltered, the deal became more favorable for shareholders, and the board sought to enforce the agreement. The document notes that several top executives were fired, including the CEO, CFO, and others, which indicates a change in leadership, likely as a result of the acquisition.\n\nAdditionally, the document refers to Mr. Musk as the one taking Twitter private, which implies he is the one acquiring the company.

The advisors listed are acting on behalf of Twitter and Musk, respectively. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the document points to Elon Musk as the acquirer of Twitter.

Again, it talks about the reasons why Musk might have bought Twitter but doesn't specify the amount he paid.\n\nThe third document is from April 26, 2022, and asks why Elon Musk is buying Twitter, assuming it's for political or social reasons. Still, no mention of the price here either.\n\nI also see some details about the legal processes, like Musk selling Tesla shares and subpoenaing former Twitter employees, but nothing about the total cost of the acquisition. There's a mention of Twitter's revenue decline and some financial figures related to Tesla stock sales, but not the purchase price of Twitter.\n\nSince none of the provided documents include the specific amount Elon Musk paid for Twitter, I can't find the exact figure.

But it’s not obvious that it wouldn’t be. And he’s a really smart guy. One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that.

I see that the document is quite detailed, listing various qualification criteria and some information about the tournament. \n\nLooking at the paragraphs, there's a part that talks about Rory McIlroy finishing second and Tiger Woods finishing 47th.

The name mentioned right before that quote is the champion, but the text just says \"the champ said.\" Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, the document also talks about Cameron Smith pushing the eventual champion hard and having a surge in Round 3. It mentions that Smith had a hot start on Sunday but made a triple bogey on the 12th hole. So the champion must be someone else, likely the one who was leading before the final round.\n\nEarlier in the document, it says that Scottie Scheffler was leading by 10 strokes before the final round. Rory McIlroy shot a 64 to finish second, but Scheffler was way ahead. So, putting it all together, the champion is Scottie Scheffler. He was the one leading, and despite some challenges from Smith and McIlroy, he held on to win.\n\nI think that's the answer.

I have this document to help me, so I'll go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of information about the Australian Open, including mentions of various players and their matches. The document talks about the Rod Laver arena and some players like Rybakina and Sabalenka, but that seems to be from a different year, maybe 2023, since it mentions #AO23. So that's probably not relevant for 2022.\n\nLooking further down, I notice a section about Rafael Nadal and Daniil Medvedev meeting in the men's final on Sunday. That makes sense because Nadal did play in the 2022 Australian Open. Then there's a part about Venus and Serena Williams not participating for the first time since 1997, which aligns with the 2022 event.\n\nNext, the document mentions Samantha Stosur retiring after the 2022 Australian Open, which she did. Then there's a detailed section about the seedings and some players, but it's a bit confusing because it references 2022 and 2023. Wait, here's a specific part: \"For the first time since 1997, neither Venus nor Serena Williams participated in the Australian Open.[7] This was the last singles major for former world No. 4 and 2011 US Open champion Samantha Stosur, who announced her retirement from the discipline.[8] She lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the second round.\"\n\nThen, under the seedings, it says the seedings are based on WTA rankings as of 10 January 2022, and points before are as of 17 January 2022. That definitely points to the 2022 Australian Open.\n\nFurther down, there's a section about Ash Barty: \"Ash Barty finally has a chance to end the hype _ and end a 44-year singles title drought for Australian women at their home Grand Slam.

She beat Danielle Collins in the final. The document says she's on a 10-match winning streak and is playing Collins. It also mentions that Collins advanced to her first Grand Slam final by beating Iga Swiatek. \n\nSo putting it all together, the document is talking about the 2022 Australian Open, where Ash Barty won the women's singles title by defeating Danielle Collins in the final. This makes sense because I recall that Barty retired later in 2022, and this was her first Australian Open title, ending a long drought for Australian women.\n</think>\n\nThe winner of the women's singles Australian Open in 2022 was Ash Barty.

It mentions that Djokovic is a favorite for Wimbledon, which is after the French Open. Then, in the second paragraph, it says that Djokovic won the final, defeating someone in the tiebreaker and second set. It also notes that this victory allowed Djokovic to break his tie with Nadal at 22 majors, moving him ahead.\n\nFurther down, the document details the women's singles title, which was won by Iga Swiatek.

Serena Williams finished her career last year with 23 majors, the most for a woman in the Open era. Margaret Court won 24, some during the amateur era. Djokovic’s win also moved back into the top spot of the ATP rankings, jumping from No. 3 to replace Carlos Alcaraz at No. 1. Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the semifinals.

In-state recruiting waned under Fuente, who signed just one recruit from the commonwealth in 2020 and was all but shut out by top-five in-state recruits during his time in Blacksburg, signing only two in his six years. The first, safety Devon Hunter, never panned out. The second, Payoute, medically retired this offseason. To give you a sense of the Hokies’ fallen standing in Virginia, Tech’s last impact top-five in-state recruit was defensive tackle Tim Settle, all the way back in 2015. With Burmeister and Robinson transferring out, quarterback and receiver were a high priority for Pry and his staff. The Hokies went the quantity route in fortifying the roster there, bringing in Wells and Brown at quarterback and Blue and North Carolina’s Stephen Gosnell at receiver. The additions of Wells and Brown allowed Tech to reconfigure its quarterback room, moving Blumrick, who started the Pinstripe Bowl, to a slash-type role.", "“I’ve always heard good things about Brent. … Good energy. Cares about the players. And obviously a good track record at Penn State. So yeah, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t do well.”  When Fuente signed the 76th-ranked recruiting class in 2020, which ranked dead last in the ACC, many viewed it as the death knell for his coaching prospects in Blacksburg. But it takes longer than a season or two for a class to truly start impacting things one way or another at a place like Virginia Tech, which is why the recruiting sins of Fuente’s past are going to be paid for by Pry and his staff in the early going. That 2020 group wasn’t just bad on paper at the time, with one four-star recruit. It’s panned out horribly too, as seven of the top eight signees in what was only a 16-man class have since transferred. Talent retention was a longstanding issue under Fuente but, after some well-regarded classes from 2017-19, so was talent acquisition. The past three classes have featured a total of five four-star players. Tech’s average recruiting ranking in the past four years is 45th nationally and seventh in the ACC, a tick below NC State and Georgia Tech.", "To that end, has hit the recruiting trail with gusto, even if the returns in the 2023 class so far have been minimal. That’s a long-term approach, however. In the short term, the Hokies added a few transfers, though not an overwhelming number, and have gone about taking stock of a roster that was last seen getting blown out of the Pinstripe Bowl 54-10 by a mediocre Maryland team. Pry’s preached competition in all facets this offseason, hoping to get the most out of the returning players and re-establish a winning culture at Virginia Tech that he was once part of as a graduate assistant for Frank Beamer and Bud Foster in the mid-’90s. Said Pry: “We have to hate losing and do anything to win.” The Hokies don’t wipe the slate clean on offense, but they come close. Virginia Tech bid adieu to last year’s starting quarterback (Braxton Burmeister, who transferred to San Diego State), its top two receivers (Tre Turner to the NFL and Tayvion Robinson to Kentucky), its top two rushers (Burmeister and versatile back Raheem Blackshear), a do-it-all tight end (James Mitchell, though he was hurt all of last year) and three mainstays on the line (Lecitus Smith, Brock Hoffman and Luke Tenuta). For all that talent, the Hokies finished 82nd nationally in yards per play (5.", "The problem has always been that Virginia Tech’s Offense has been consistently unsophisticated and tragically underperforming for nearly a generation. Even in the heyday years the offense was never much to write home to Mommy about. It always relied heavily on the physical talents of a few key players and scoring just enough points to win close games that the defense kept in check. If the QB was good and had some good receivers and running backs the rather pedestrian affair managed to get the job done and a few folks drafted into the NFL. As far as scheme, game planning, and play calling, Tech’s “Theory of Offense” managed to be run the ball twice throw on third down and do that until stopped by the goal line or a 4th down.  Look, in the “old days” of college football that formula, and a great defense and surprising special teams netted ten-win seasons and bowl games. It’s not those days anymore. Offenses that do not plan to score 35-points or more, every single game, are not going to get much further than a booger bowl and a bag of goodies for showing up around the holidays.

While Demirors recognizes that most legislation currently isn’t being drafted around this aspect, she is hopeful that Texas and other states continue to take a welcoming approach to initiatives such as mining. Demirors also noted that the right to consumer and financial privacy isn’t being considered in crypto regulations, remarking that most of these bills want more financial surveillance. “I think as an industry, it’s important for us to push back on that, particularly in a world where CBDCs are being explored.” Finally, it’s important to point out that the crypto industry is continuing to bring on key players to help with advancements. For example, Grayscale Investments recently hired Donald B. Verrilli, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to join the firm to help push for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Toomey added that while he has not released a bill yet, there are “bridgeable differences” between his draft and the legislation from Lummis and Gillibrand: Echoing Toomey, Long mentioned that the bipartisan bill is an important advancement for the crypto sector, stating, “This is the bill to watch in Washington. There are now 50 different crypto bills that have been introduced in Congress and there is only one that is bipartisan sponsored by the powerful senator from New York State, along with the powerful senator on senate banking from Wyoming, which is the state leading digital assets. That is quite a combination.” Long added that stablecoin regulations and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will be major topics of discussion this year. For instance, although President Biden released an executive order in March 2022 calling for the research and development of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency, Long remarked that she does not believe the U.S. will issue a CBDC. “The Federal Reserve will put out the FedNow Service by the end of this year, which is only six months away.", "However, no rules have been revealed yet, so we don’t know what this will look like.” Moreover, Long predicts that stablecoins will be a main focus for regulators, pointing out that Wyoming’s special purpose depository regime falls into this category, alongside The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) regulatory guidance for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins issued by DFS-regulated entities. Yet, Long explained that “it will be a couple of years before we realistically see what happens in terms of a law that actually passes” regarding stablecoins. She further remarked that regulators have had the opportunity to create regulations around stablecoins but have yet to act. She said: To Long’s point, Toomey said that he thinks there is now pressure and momentum to pass stablecoin legislation. “U.S Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in front of the banking committee that we should do it this year and I think that is realistic,” said Toomey. He added that the pressure has become greater due to the recent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. “I think it influences legislation in the sense that it has drawn attention to the crypto space, and it’s a wake up call to the federal government.", "To Youssef’s point, Web3 and new tools to advance crypto ecosystems were hot topics of discussion. For example, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares — a digital asset investment firm — told Cointelegraph that despite the bear market, she has seen an increase in people interested in different facets of the crypto industry: Demirors gave a keynote at the event on cults and how the crypto community is currently creating shared identity, belief systems and lifestyle rituals around emerging projects. “Cults usually have a negative connotation, but there is a massive crisis of meaning in our world today.

She and hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, one of 10 candidates eliminated in the first round on April 10, both quickly pitched forward Sunday night to France’s legislative election in June, urging voters to give them a parliamentary majority to hamstring Macron. Le Pen’s score this time rewarded her years-long efforts to make her far-right politics more palatable to voters. Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers.  Le Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize “our daily lives — salaries, taxes, pensions.” The drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term.

It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream. Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": "\n\nYes, the question is addressed by the documents.

I don't have that information off the top of my head, so I'll have to look through the provided document to see if it's mentioned anywhere. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the document carefully. The document talks a lot about the camera improvements in the iPhone 14 Pro compared to the iPhone 13 Pro. It mentions things like better noise reduction, dynamic range, and the Photonic Engine. There's a section about the ultra-wide camera getting an upgrade with a larger sensor and autofocus. The front-facing camera also gets some attention with improved dynamic range and sharpness. \n\nI see details about the telephoto camera being similar to the previous model but benefiting from the Photonic Engine. There's a mention of macro mode and how the main camera switches to the ultra-wide for closer shots. The document also discusses the TrueDepth sensor and the Dynamic Island feature, but that's more about the front bezel and Face ID rather than the main camera specs.\n\nNow, when it comes to megapixels, the document doesn't explicitly state the number. It talks about the larger sensor and better image quality, which might imply a higher megapixel count, but it doesn't give a specific number. I know from general knowledge that the iPhone 14 Pro has a 48MP main camera, but since that information isn't in the provided document, I can't rely on that. \n\nThe document focuses more on the features and improvements rather than the technical specifications like megapixels.

Therefore, I should respond that there's insufficient information in the documents to answer the question.\n</think>\n\nI cannot answer the question because of insufficient information in the documents.", "docs": ["It’s often disingenuous to compare an iPhone’s new camera to that of the iPhone that came a mere year before it; the small steps made can be more or less significant, but we forget that most people don’t upgrade their phones every year. What matters is how the camera truly performs when used. This year is a bit different.  I am reminded of a post in which John Gruber writes about a 1991 Radio Shack ad (referencing this 2014 post by Steve Cichon). On this back-of-the-newspaper ad, Radioshack advertised 15 interesting gadgets for sale. Of these 15 devices, 13 are now always in your pocket — including the still camera. While this is true to an extent, the camera on a phone will simply never be as good as the large sensors and lenses of big cameras. This is a matter of physics. For most, it is approaching a level of ‘good enough’. What’s good enough? To truly be good enough, it has to capture reality to a certain standard. One of the greatest limitations I ran into as a photographer with the iPhone was simply their reproduction or reality at scale. iPhone photos looked good on an iPhone screen; printed out or when seen on even an iPad-sized display, their lack of detail and resolution made them an obvious cellphone capture. Beyond that, it was a feeling; a certain, unmistakable rendering that just didn’t look right.", "Combined with the larger sensor, I can see the difference compared to the iPhone 13 Pro in all the photos I shot at dusk. In the photos below, take a look at the detail captured on the tree branches by the skyline.  The newer phone also has better noise reduction in low light, without night mode engaged. Dynamic range is improved in low light too, capturing more shadow and highlight detail than the older phone. For night mode shots specifically, both the phones use similar exposure times ranging from 1 to 3 seconds depending on the lighting conditions. The iPhone 14 Pro's picture below has more accurate white balance overall and slightly better detail when you zoom in. Both the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro shoot in 4K at up to 60fps. The video image looks similar when filming on the main rear camera. But the iPhone 14 Pro unlocks additional video tools like Action mode. This is like having a gimbal attached to your phone to give smooth results when moving, except you don't need any additional hardware -- it's all done in-phone.  Action mode crops in slightly to your image and drops the resolution from 4K to 2.8K. But I think the results are incredibly impressive, especially when compared to the same video shot on the iPhone 13 Pro.", "Impressively, the TrueDepth sensor also retains incredibly precise depth data sensing, despite its much smaller package in the Dynamic Island cutout area.  This is one of the times where Apple glosses over a very significant technological leap that a hugely talented team no doubt worked hard on. The competing Android flagship phones have not followed Apple down the technological path of high-precision, infrared-based Face ID, as it requires large sensors that create screen cutouts.  The ‘notch’ had shrunk in the last generation of iPhones, but this far smaller array retains incredible depth sensing abilities that we haven’t seen another product even approximate. And while shipping a software feat — the dynamic island deserves all the hype it gets — Apple also shipped a significant camera upgrade that every user will notice in day to day usage. Time to break into that large camera bump on the rear of iPhone 14 Pro. The ultra-wide camera, introduced with iPhone 11 in 2019, has long played a background role to the main wide camera due to its smaller sensor and lack of sharpness.  Last year, Apple surprised us by giving the entire ultra-wide package a significant upgrade: a more complex lens design allowed for autofocus and extremely-close focus for macro shots, and a larger sensor collected more light and allowed for far more detailed shots.  We reviewed it as finally growing into its own: a ‘proper’ camera.", "While the sensor size of the front-facing camera isn’t massive (nor do we believe it has to be), upgrades in its lens and sensor allowed for some significant improvements in dynamic range, sharpness and quality. The actual jump between a previous-generation iPhone’s front camera and this new shooter are significant enough for most people to notice immediately. In our testing, the iPhone 14 Pro achieved far sharper shots with vastly — and we mean vastly — superior dynamic range and detail. The previous cameras were simply not capable of delivering very high-quality images or video in challenging mixed light or backlit subjects. We’re seeing some significant advancements made through better software processing (something Apple calls the Photonic Engine) and hardware.  While the sensor is larger and there is now variable focus (yes, you can use manual focus on the selfie camera with an app like Halide now!) you shouldn’t expect beautiful bokeh; the autofocus simply allows for much greater sharpness across the frame, with a slight background blur when your subject (no doubt a face) is close enough. Most of the time it’s subtle, and very nice.  Notable is that the front facing camera is able to focus quite close — which can result in some pleasing shallow depth of field between your close-up subject and the background: Low light shots are far more usable, with less smudging apparent.", "When you try to take a photo with the main camera and are standing very close to a subject, the iPhone 14 Pro switches to the ultrawide camera and crops the framing to mimic the main camera. This allows for a closer focus, which is great for close-up shots of small things.  Macro mode lets you get within inches of your subject and keep it in focus, like this Lego car. Last year's 13 Pro had a similar feature, but with the new ultrawide, macro photos have better image quality, especially in medium and low light. Another macro photo from the 14 Pro. The 14 Pro nails the focus on Lego Batman in this macro photo. The telephoto camera is basically identical to the one on last year's 13 Pro, but it gets a lift from the 14 Pro's Photonic Engine. Under good lighting, like in the picture below, the telephoto camera takes good photos. Notice in particular the colors and how the camera handles skin tones. A telephoto shot of folks noshing in a parklet. As with the ultrawide, image quality is a step behind the main camera -- especially in dimmer environments. I took this photo of the Embarcadero's Ferry Building during blue hour, with the 14 Pro's telephoto camera. Below is a Portrait mode picture of Maisie the cat taken indoors with the telephoto camera."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": ": No, the question is not addressed by the documents."}

They talk about the tools and parts being available for purchase, but I don't see any mention of rental costs there. It says you can buy the parts and tools, and for certain repairs, you get a credit when you return a replaced part. But no info on renting.\n\nLooking at the next part of the document, there's a personal account from someone who tried the repair process. He bought a battery replacement kit and spent around $120, which is more than what Apple would charge for the repair. He mentions renting the tool kit but doesn't specify the cost. He also talks about missing items like heat gloves and tweezers, and buying extra supplies like rubbing alcohol. So, the focus here is on the total cost he incurred, not the rental fee itself.\n\nFurther down, the document explains the process: you review the manual, then buy the parts and tools. It mentions that you can rent or buy professional-grade tools from the Self Service Repair Store. So, it does say that renting is an option, but again, no prices are provided.\n\nThere's a section that lists the tools included in each iPhone repair toolkit. It mentions that each toolkit comes with specific tools and that the kits weigh 43 and 36 pounds, totaling 79 pounds. It also notes that these kits are on wheels and can be stacked. However, no rental cost is mentioned here either.\n\nThe last part of the document discusses that the toolkits are not cost-effective for individual users, even skilled ones. It mentions that Apple was accused of launching the program to head off legislation, implying that the program might not be intended for average consumers. But again, no specific rental costs are provided.\n\nPutting this all together, the documents provide details about the availability of toolkits, the process, and the challenges faced by someone who tried the repair. However, there's no information provided about the actual cost to rent the tool kit. The press release and the subsequent articles focus more on the availability, the tools included, and the experiences of someone who used the service, but not the rental fees.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, there's insufficient information to determine the rental cost of the tool kit. The documents mention that renting is an option, but they don't specify the price.

Self Service Repair is available in the US and will expand to additional countries — beginning in Europe — later this year. The new online store offers more than 200 individual parts and tools, enabling customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices to complete repairs on the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups and iPhone SE (3rd generation), such as the display, battery, and camera. Later this year the program will also include manuals, parts, and tools to perform repairs on Mac computers with Apple silicon. To start the Self Service Repair process, a customer will first review the repair manual for the product they want to repair by visiting support.apple.com/self-service-repair.

The thing you should understand about Apple’s home repair process is that it’s a far cry from traditional DIY if you opt for the kit — which I did, once I saw the repair manual only contains instructions for Apple’s own tools. (You can just buy a battery if you want.) I expected Apple would send me a small box of screwdrivers, spudgers, and pliers; I own a mini iPhone, after all. Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases — 79 pounds of tools — on my front porch. I couldn’t believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple’s paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started. Step one of opening an iPhone is, basically, using a hefty machine to suck the screen off the top. Here, I wasn’t microwaving a jelly-filled sock to loosen the Apple goop holding my screen down! Apple lets you rent an industrial-grade heat station that looks like a piece of lab equipment, right down to the big red safety dial you twist to release the emergency-off button and the suction-cup-tipped mechanical lifting arm. It looks pretty cool.", "For the review, Barbera first explained that he is not a skilled repairman and purchased parts for a battery replacement for his iPhone 12 mini, along with the tool kit. After renting the tool kit and purchasing the battery bundle, Barbera ended up spending about $120 to repair the device himself instead of the $69 it would have cost him to let Apple replace it. In the review he noted a few components were missing from the kit including heat protective-gloves and tweezers, both of which were stated as required in the manual. Barbera also purchased extra supplies that were recommended but not required, such as rubbing alcohol to help loosen the adhesive.  Not every repair is more expensive. Several would end up being cheaper to repair yourself, and Apple does offer return credit for select parts that are replaced as a small silver lining, but according to MacRumors, the risk of damaging your own device and having to pay even more to replace it is far greater than the benefits. As an average consumer, Barbera described the process as difficult and mentioned several times that he feared he’d punctured the battery, which can be extremely dangerous and even result in a house fire.  “Apple does a great job of quickly sending you everything for this and labeling and organizing things, but ultimately it comes down to how well you can follow the instructions, how much patience you have and whether or not you really want to risk your phone of further damage if you mess something up.", "Self Service Repair is intended for individuals with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices.

This year’s Costume Institute exhibition, “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” celebrates the full work and life of Karl Lagerfeld, so the dress code was, fittingly, “in honor of Karl.” As Lagerfeld designed for many houses—including his eponymous brand, Patou, Balmain, Chloé, Fendi, and Chanel—attendees had no shortage of inspiration.  Below, everything you need to know about the 2023 Met Gala.  The 2023 Met Gala took place on Monday, May 1 in New York City. It celebrated the opening of the Costume Institute exhibition “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.”  Fans followed all the action on Vogue’s livestream. If you missed the night-of action, you can catch catch a replay. The red carpet was live-streamed on Vogue.com and was also broadcast live across our digital platforms (as well as on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter).", "\"I'm hoping that this sculpture will be a reflective moment and allow us to think about what these symbols mean to us in a personal way,\" Valentino told Vogue in 2022. In 2022, celebrity attendees were greeted by a string orchestra, as pictured above. Photos from inside the event showed celebrities posing in front of the staircase. For the Met Gala in 2019, the grand staircase was flanked by wall-to-wall installations of pink feathers to celebrate the night's \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" theme. The decorations change from year to year. Last year, the decorations heavily featured red flowers and roses. Wintour also serves as the night's host. Earlier this year, reports emerged that the guest list would be slimmed down for the 2023 Met Gala, though Wintour herself never confirmed that to be the case. Inside the 2022 Met Gala, guests could be seen milling about from table to table in front of large projection screens. There was also a stage set up for live performances. \"We start with a seating document when the names come together in December,\" Kiernan told Vogue ahead of the 2023 Met Gala. \"The actual seating chart doesn't come together until about a month before the event, when we get a sense for the layout of the room, and the flow of the evening.\" The dinner itself for fashion's biggest night is curated by renowned chefs.", "As for the exhibition, presented across 13 of the American period rooms in the museum, it “provides a historical context for Lexicon, in a way”, Bolton told Vogue. “The stories really reflect the evolution of American style, but they also explore the work of individual tailors, dress-makers, and designers,” he says. “What’s exciting for me is that some of the names will be very familiar to students of fashion, like Charles James, Halston, and Oscar de la Renta, but a lot of the other names really have been forgotten, overlooked or relegated into the footnotes of fashion history. So one of the main intentions of the exhibition is to spotlight the talents and contributions of these individuals, and many of them are women.” On 17 March, Vogue announced that its 2022 hosts would include Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lin-Manuel Miranda will serve as the night’s official co-chairs, while designer Tom Ford, Instagram’s Adam Mosseri, and Vogue’s Anna Wintour will continue as honorary co-chairs.

(AAPL) is expecting a slowdown in the economy, and has projected lower earnings and revenue growth as a result. The company is reported to be taking a more cautious approach by holding off on backfilling some positions or adding new staff as the threat of recession looms.   Even so, Apple announced it is planning to increase its compensation budget. This is likely in response to unionization efforts at its stores across the U.S.   The focus remains on Apple’s services revenue and its impact on overall profit because sales of advertising, the App Store and other services generate larger margins than the company’s physical products. Even with a focus on services, Apple is still preparing to launch more products. The company is reported to be planning to introduce several new iPhones, Apple watches, desktops, laptops, and more.   Investors should note that much like other tech companies, Apple’s share price has declined, but it is still outperforming many of its peers on the Nasdaq. Despite outperforming others, analysts are expecting Apple’s revenue not to grow at the rate it did in FY2021. Restrictive pandemic lockdowns in China that affected its production and demand there, recession fears, and inflation are leading many consumers to cut back on buying new electronics. This doesn’t seem to have caught Apple by surprise, as it plans to keep iPhone production flat in 2022.", "August 2023 Worldwide 2004 to 2023 The quarterly periods for Apple's fiscal year include the following: early October to late December of the previous year (first quarter), early January to late March of the stated year (second quarter), early April to late June of the stated year (3rd quarter) and early July to late September of the stated year (4th quarter).\r \r  Telecommunications Quarterly smartphone market share worldwide by vendor 2009-2023 Consumer Electronics Apple's revenue worldwide 2004-2022 Consumer Electronics Apple's revenue broken down by geographical region 2012-2023, by quarter Consumer Electronics Number of employees of Apple 2005-2022 To download this statistic in XLS format you need a Statista Account To download this statistic in PNG format you need a Statista Account To download this statistic in PDF format you need a Statista Account As a Premium user you get access to the detailed source references and background information about this statistic.

The allure of fast, easy money has a major pull when you grow up with nothing.  For many years, I thought the street life was the most exciting thing in the world. Until I met Madeleine Sackler. She discovered a talent in me that I didn’t know I possessed. Filmmaking occupied the space in my mind that was previously occupied by the street life; it was a breath of fresh air, and it gave me a sense of hope. That’s especially important in a place where most people lose their purpose for living. Making this movie showed that people are willing to give us a second chance. But you also have to be ready for that second chance, and take nothing for granted. Shortly after we finished filming, my son was killed on the outside.

I observed him closely, how he prepared for scenes, how he tried to bring out every little emotion. One time he told me to shake my leg during a scene, and it made it so much more intense. Sometimes people mistook Jeffrey for an actual guy in prison, which to me shows how much the outfits matter. That piece of cloth tells people you’re guilty. When we filmed the fight scenes, I had to unlearn some of the things I would normally do in a fight, because the stunt coordinator said certain things look better on camera. A scene from \"O.G.\" with Jeffrey Wright and Theothus Carter.   Those 15 weeks were the greatest experience of my life, save for the birth of my son.

The company owns some of the largest social media companies and messaging apps in the world, including Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.  BlenderBot 3's algorithm searches the internet to inform its answers. It is likely its views on Mr Zuckerberg have been \"learnt' from other people's opinions that the algorithm has analysed.  The Wall Street Journal has reported BlenderBot 3 told one of its journalists that Donald Trump was, and will always be, the US president.  A business Insider journalist said the chatbot called Mr Zuckerberg \"creepy\".  Meta has made the BlenderBot 3 public, and risked bad publicity, for a reason. It needs data.  \"Allowing an AI system to interact with people in the real world leads to longer, more diverse conversations, as well as more varied feedback,\" Meta said in a blog post.  Chatbots that learn from interactions with people can learn from their good and bad behaviour. In 2016 Microsoft apologised after Twitter users taught its chatbot to be racist. Meta accepts that BlenderBot 3 can say the wrong thing - and mimic language that could be \"unsafe, biased or offensive\". The company said it had installed safeguards, however, the chatbot could still be rude. When I asked the BlenderBot 3 what it thought about me, it said it had never heard of me.", "“Initial experiments already show that as more people interact with the model, the more it learns from its experiences and the better and safer it becomes over time,” the company says, “though safety remains an open problem.” Let’s pause and take in those last few words before continuing. When Meta announced the project, my eyebrows raised slightly at the sample conversation it had chosen to illustrate the post with – a chat between a user and BlenderBot in which the AI, well, lies. When asked what it’s doing it says “I’ve been working on my new book all night”, and follows up with the claim the book will be its ninth, with previous novels including “a modern retelling of pride and prejudice”. The question of what it means to want an AI to tell the truth is a tricky one. As we saw in June with Google’s LaMDA, the fundamental goal of these models is to provide a user with the appropriate text to finish their prompt: if you ask a machine what it did at the weekend, the machine is probably correct in assuming that you want to engage in light role-play, rather than stick to the facts. Nonetheless, the decision to advertise BlenderBot with a conversation in which it lied to a user is suggestive of the attitude the company is taking with it. The idea is that, by releasing the project as a chatbot on the internet, Meta has more leeway to experiment without risking negative outcomes.", "However, LaMDA, the other advanced conversational AI by the search giant, was mired in controversy when the company tried to suppress the fact that LaMDA believes it is a person and wants to be respected. Blake Lemoine, the Google techie tasked with determining if LaMDA had racist or hateful tendencies in its conversational responses, blew the whistle and was ultimately suspended by Google. South Korean startup Scatter Lab’s Luda chatbot also turned racist and responded with anti-LGBTQ remarks and was temporarily shut down last year.

So if GPT-3.5 was an improvement over GPT-3, which was from 2020, then ChatGPT must have come after that. I'm pretty sure the release was in November 2022. That seems right because I remember the initial launch being free to the public, allowing people to try it out without paying, which helped it gain a lot of traction quickly.\n\nI also think that after its release, there were several updates and announcements, like the introduction of GPT-4 in early 2023.

The foundation of ChatGPT is an improved version of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model known as “GPT-3.5.” This fine-tuned language model allows ChatGPT to generate text based on user prompts with impressive accuracy and coherence. When a user interacts with ChatGPT, the chatbot generates text based on the user’s prompt or input. It employs the language model architecture created by OpenAI called the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). The specific GPT used by ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series.

Let me look through the provided documents to see if there's any mention of the release date.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the text for any dates. The documents talk about GPT-4's improvements, capabilities, and some rumors. There's a mention of a tweet by Robert Scoble from November 8, 2022, where he talks about GPT-4 being next-level. But that's just a tweet, not an official release date.\n\nI also see that Sam Altman was interviewed on the StrictlyVC program, where he discussed the release timeline. He mentioned that GPT-4 would come out when they were confident it was safe and responsible, and that they'd release technology more slowly than people might like. But he didn't specify a date in that interview.\n\nLooking further, there's a part that mentions GPT-3.5 was used to create ChatGPT, and GPT-4 is an improvement over that. However, there's no explicit release date for GPT-4 in the documents provided.\n\nWait, in the first paragraph, it says, \"OpenAI does note that GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to disallowed content...\" but that doesn't give a release date. The documents also discuss the capabilities of GPT-4, like passing a bar exam and creating games, but again, no specific release date.\n\nI think the key here is that the documents don't provide a release date for GPT-4. They focus more on its features, improvements, and some rumors, but not when it was actually released. Therefore, based on the information given, I can't determine the release date.\n</think>\n\nI cannot answer the question because of insufficient information in the documents.", "docs": ["OpenAI does note, though, that it made improvements in particular areas; GPT-4 is less likely to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals, for one. The company says that GPT-4 is 82% less likely overall to respond to requests for “disallowed” content compared to GPT-3.5 and responds to sensitive requests — e.g. medical advice and anything pertaining to self-harm — in accordance with OpenAI’s policies 29% more often. Image Credits: OpenAI Image Credits: OpenAI There’s clearly a lot to unpack with GPT-4. But OpenAI, for its part, is forging full steam ahead — evidently confident in the enhancements it’s made. “We look forward to GPT-4 becoming a valuable tool in improving people’s lives by powering many applications,” OpenAI wrote. “There’s still a lot of work to do, and we look forward to improving this model through the collective efforts of the community building on top of, exploring, and contributing to the model.", "6] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[7] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[8] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[9] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.  Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[10]  OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\"[11] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[12] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[13] in downstream scaling laws.", "That rumor was debunked by Sam Altman in the StrictlyVC interview program, where he also said that OpenAI doesn’t have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to learn anything that a human can. Altman commented: “I saw that on Twitter.  It’s complete b——t. The GPT rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. …People are begging to be disappointed and they will be. …We don’t have an actual AGI and I think that’s sort of what’s expected of us and you know, yeah… we’re going to disappoint those people. “ The two facts about GPT-4 that are reliable are that OpenAI has been cryptic about GPT-4 to the point that the public knows virtually nothing, and the other is that OpenAI won’t release a product until it knows it is safe. So at this point, it is difficult to say with certainty what GPT-4 will look like and what it will be capable of. But a tweet by technology writer Robert Scoble claims that it will be next-level and a disruption. There are several coming that will completely change the game. GPT-4 is next level, I hear, for instance.  There is a revolution in AI coming. — Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 8, 2022 Disruption is coming.  GPT-4 is better than anyone expects.", "Here’s what I see the recently released GPT-4 having to offer those looking to be at the forefront in their industries. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 \"passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT-3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%.\" On Twitter, I've seen many developers testing out GPT-4 with requests for it to code old-school arcade games. While GPT-3 often provided buggy code that needed re-prompting, GPT-4 in many cases gives perfectly working code to start. One Twitter user reported recreating Snake, a popular classic game, in twenty minutes in GPT-4 without any know-how of JavaScript. While some see it as potentially concerning for programmers, my company is considering allowing candidates to use it in interviews since they'll be expected to utilize it on the job. There are legitimate concerns, though, and some big tech companies have banned the use of it for engineering out of fear that their private company code will make its way into the hands of OpenAI to train future models. Even with this in mind, there is plenty the tool has to offer. Unlike GPT-3.5, the newest model accepts images as input alongside text instructions. For example, users can input a handmade sketch into the AI chatbot, and it will transform the sketch into a functional web page.", "Sam Altman was interviewed recently for the StrictlyVC program, where he confirms that OpenAI is working on a video model, which sounds incredible but could also lead to serious negative outcomes. While the video part was not said to be a component of GPT-4, what was of interest and possibly related, is that Altman was emphatic that OpenAI would not release GPT-4 until they were assured that it was safe. The relevant part of the interview occurs at the 4:37 minute mark: The interviewer asked: “Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?” Sam Altman responded: “It’ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it much  longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time I realized like people want the shiny toy and it’s frustrating and I totally get that.” Twitter is abuzz with rumors that are difficult to confirm.

It says, \"For the most up-to-date information about known issues for Windows 11, version 22H2, please go to the Windows release health dashboard.\" That tells me that 22H2 is a later update, but the exact release date isn't directly stated here.\n\nI remember that Microsoft usually releases major updates in the second half of the year, around September or October. The version numbers like 21H2 and 22H2 suggest that H2 refers to the second half of 2021 and 2022, respectively. So, 22H2 should be around the second half of 2022, which would be September or October 2022.\n\nLooking again, the document mentions that the 22H2 version introduces features like Optimizations for windowed games, HEVC support, and other policies. It doesn't explicitly give the release date, but considering the naming convention and typical release cycles, it's logical to infer that 22H2 was released in the latter part of 2022.\n\nAdditionally, the document discusses Windows Insider builds and changes in their channels in February 2022 and March 2023, but those don't directly impact the release date of 22H2. However, knowing that 21H2 was October 2021, it's reasonable to assume that 22H2 would follow a similar annual schedule, likely around October 2022.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the document doesn't provide the exact release date, based on the version naming and Microsoft's usual release patterns, I can conclude that Windows 11 22H2 was released in October 2022.\n</think>\n\nMicrosoft released Windows 11 version 22H2 in October 2022.", "docs": ["Windows 11 is a major release of the Windows NT developed by Microsoft that was released in October 2021. Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft described Windows as an \"operating system as a service\" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support.  Windows Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders in four different channels. Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channel receive updates prior to those in the Beta Channel, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the Release Preview Channel do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are comparatively more stable.  As with Windows 10 (since version 20H2), mainstream builds of Windows 11 are labeled \"YYHX\", with YY representing the two-digit year and X representing the half-year of planned release (for example, version 21H2 refers to builds which initially released in the second half of 2021).

The modest GPU allows for AMD’s CPUs to supply their own graphics, eliminating the need for a discrete GPU just to boot a system while, we expect, providing enough performance for basic desktop work. The new CPU family will also come with a new socket and motherboard platform, which AMD is dubbing AM5. The first significant socket update for AMD in six years will bring with it a slew of changes and new features, including a switch to an LGA-style socket (LGA1718) and support for DDR5 memory. Providing the back-end for AM5 will be AMD’s 600 series chipsets, with AMD set to release both enthusiast and mainstream chipsets.
