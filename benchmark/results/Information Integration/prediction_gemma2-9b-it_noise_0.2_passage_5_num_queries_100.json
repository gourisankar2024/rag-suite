Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions. The other two-time winners were Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger. Dr.", "Oct 4, 2022 ... The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 · Alain Aspect · John F.

Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

Honorary chairs for the evening are Tom Ford, Adam Mosseri, and Anna Wintour.  “Fashion is both a harbinger of cultural shifts and a record of the forces, beliefs, and events that shape our lives,” said Max Hollein, the Marina Kellen French Director of The Met. “This two-part exhibition considers how fashion reflects evolving notions of identity in America and explores a multitude of perspectives through presentations that speak with powerful immediacy to some of the complexities of history. In looking at the past through this lens, we can consider the aesthetic and cultural impact of fashion on historical aspects of American life.” Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, said: “American fashion has traditionally been described through the language of sportswear and ready-to-wear, emphasizing principles of simplicity, practicality, functionality, and egalitarianism.  Generally denied the emotional rhetoric applied to European fashion, American fashion has evolved a vernacular that tends to sit in direct opposition to that of the haute couture.", "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.

For Q3, Alphabet posted revenue of $69.1 billion and a net income of $13.9 billion — so Google Cloud should not be hampered by a cash crunch. Quite the opposite: The comments from Pichai and Porat clearly indicate that the only factor that could impact that willingness to “invest meaningfully” is Google Cloud’s ability to sustain the hypergrowth-level momentum it has demonstrated over the past couple of years. In parallel, Alphabet expects that just as it’s willing to prime the Google Cloud pump, so too must Google Cloud be able to show that it can deploy those investments aggressively but also wisely and responsibly.", "Advertisement Supported by Google’s parent company reported earnings that were below analysts’ expectations, bringing in $13.9 billion in profit on $69.1 billion in sales. By Nico Grant Even Alphabet, the parent company of Google and one of the internet’s most entrenched businesses, was not immune to the punishing blows of the global economy and a sharp slowdown in the online advertising that is essential to the company’s profits. Alphabet on Tuesday reported a net profit of $13.9 billion in the third quarter, down 27 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbed 6 percent to $69.1 billion. The earnings fell short of analysts’ estimates of $16.9 billion in profit on $71 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by FactSet. Since Alphabet last released financial results in July, the global economy has worsened, with rising inflation and interest rates as well as slowing growth prompting fears that even tech giants like Google’s parent, insulated by their popular products and piles of cash, would feel some financial pain. Those worries were realized in Tuesday’s results, which signaled that the online ad market was slowing as advertisers slashed budgets. Alphabet executives said on a call with analysts that they had seen less ad spending for insurance, loans, mortgages and crypto, as well as fewer gaming ads. That coincided with a decline in gaming since the height of the pandemic. The strong dollar also crimped the company’s performance in the most recent quarter."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

Nominations were revealed in December 2022, three months after the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) confirmed that the Golden Globes would air on TV once again for its milestone 80th ceremony.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies.

Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.", "Stepping away from the brink of cancellation after two years of tumult, the rebooted Golden Globes ceremony  returns to the small screen Tuesday night.

This post originally appeared on Chicago Booth’s Initiative on Global Markets. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke of the Brookings Institution, Douglas Diamond at Chicago and Philip Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis “for their research on banks and financial crises”. Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "Oct 6, 2022 ...

The 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences went to Ben Bernanke, a household name, and Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, who were largely unknown to the public but immensely influential within the profession. Few economists predicted the 2008 financial crisis, but when it happened, few found it baffling; in the days after the fall of Lehman, economists could in effect be found roaming the halls of their departments, muttering “Diamond-Dybvig, Diamond-Dybvig.” This year’s prize was, in a way, unusual.

The company worked with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to co-develop a new \"4N\" fabrication process that NVIDIA says is up to two times more power efficient than the 8nm process it used for its 30 Series cards.  Ray tracing performance is significantly improved thanks to Ada Lovelace featuring NVIDIA's new third-generation RT Cores, and the inclusion of a new rendering technique called Shader Execution Reordering and DLSS 3.0. In some games, NVIDIA said you can expect two to three times better ray tracing performance than what was possible with its Ampere GPUs. The company demoed Cyberpunk 2077 running at a near consistent 100 frames per second with all of the game's ray tracing features set to max.

Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015.  Sunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party.

He is of Indian heritage and Hindu faith. \"Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin's war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains the world over,\" Sunak said in his first address as prime minister outside the PM's residence at Number 10 Downing Street. He paid tribute to his predecessor, Liz Truss, but said \"some mistakes were made,\" and that he had been chosen by lawmakers in his party, \"in part, to fix them.\" Sunak, who used to work in finance, is — alongside his wife, tech heiress Akshata Murty — one of the wealthiest people in the U.K. and served as treasury secretary under Boris Johnson.

The process was largely a formality, to make official the results of an internal power struggle in one of Britain's main political parties. Johnson's three-year tenure was peppered with scandals, which eventually resulted in his ouster. So, who is the woman the Conservative Party has chosen to replace him? Like Johnson, 47-year-old Truss is a member of Britain's Conservative party. She has served as a member of the British Parliament for 12 years and held cabinet roles within various Conservative governments for eight years, serving most recently as Foreign Secretary. Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.

In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions?

But the same issue is at hand – when will this show up in a user’s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers.

But this could be one of those years in which one film dominates the night.

In fact, I had predicted that Team Blake’s “pure country” contestant, a 22-year-old Georgia crooner by the extremely Opry-marquee-worthy name Bryce Leatherwood, would take the Season 22 title. (I must also gloatingly point out that I predicted the finale’s entire leaderboard, from fifth through first place, but I’ll get to those results in a bit.) What did make Tuesday’s finale surprising and historic, however, was the fact that Bryce was the first Instant Save contestant to ever win The Voice. And Bryce was actually saved more than once this season: first during the Battle Rounds, by his coach, and then during the top 16 results show's Instant Save sing-off, as a viewer-voted wild card. However, Bryce peaked at just the right time this week, with Monday’s razzle-dazzling, personality-plus cover of Elvis Presley’s “T-R-O-U-B-L-E,” and by the end of that top five performance night, Blake’s wife and fellow coach, Gwen Stefani, was predicting that Bryce would win.", "This was the first playoffs to not be contested live since season thirteen; it was prerecorded and taped at the same stage as the prior two rounds, hence the lack of a interactive viewer voting component or a subsequent results episode.

Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested.

The playoffs began on April 16 and ended on June 16 with the conclusion of the 2022 NBA Finals. The playoffs also returned to its normal April–June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in two postponements in 2020 and 2021.  Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[12]  Each conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding.", "This was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, and the second since the New Jersey Nets relocated to Brooklyn in 2012, with the Nets winning the first three meetings.[44]   Despite finishing the game with 21 turnovers and blowing a 16-point lead, the Bucks outlasted the Bulls 93–86. Giannis Antetokounmpo finished the game with 27 points and 16 rebounds. The Bulls struggled on offense, shooting a season-low 32.3% from the floor, with DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine shooting a combined 12-of-44 (27.3%).   While the Bulls were leading by as much as 18 in the third quarter, they withstood two furious rallies in both the third and fourth quarters by the Bucks, with DeMar DeRozan scoring a playoff career-high 41 points. This was the Bulls' first playoff victory since Game 2 of the 2017 Eastern Conference First Round against the Boston Celtics. Two Bucks players suffered injuries during the game: Bobby Portis left mid-game after suffering a \"right eye abrasion\" and Khris Middleton suffered a sprained MCL in his left knee.   Despite Chicago hosting their first playoff game in five years, Milwaukee dominated throughout the game. Grayson Allen came off the bench and led the Bucks in points with 22, along with Bobby Portis collecting 16 rebounds, tying a career-high.", "This was the second championship win for the Bucks and their first since 1971.

Nvidia led the way with an impressive 343% increase in its stock price, followed by Tesla with a 276% increase. Amazon has been the only company with negative figures over these 3 years, reflecting a -5% performance. However, it has shown slight signs of recovery from mid-2022 until June 29, 2023, achieving a gain of 12%. It is worth mentioning that the excessive surge in Nvidia’s stock price has been driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence industry. This has led the company to reach the milestone of one trillion dollars in market capitalization in early June 2023, becoming the seventh US company to achieve this feat, which is quite impressive for the renowned gaming GPU company. According to a report from Nasdaq, the best company in the MATANA group for long-term investment is Alphabet. In February 2023, Wall Street maintained a unanimous stance on buying Alphabet shares, with 32 analyst firms promoting its “purchase”. The analysts based their recommendations on Google’s market dominance in search (76% dominance compared to other search engines) since Google is owned by Alphabet.

Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021. The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products.

Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months.", "This has ushered in a new collection of ‘must-have’ tech innovators that dominate their respective markets. Yet with these names commanding $100 to $200 share prices, owing all six may be impractical (until a MATANA exchange-traded fund (ETF) invariably comes along). So how is one to choose among the cream of the crop?  Hakuna Matata, no worries. According to Wall Street research firms, these three MATANA stocks have the best return potential over the next 12-plus months. With an average analyst price target of $137, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most room to run. At current levels, this equates to more than 40% upside. Some sell-side firms see the e-commerce leader going much higher.  Earlier this month, Tigress Financial gave Amazon a $192 target, which suggests the stock can double from here. Given the challenging macro backdrop, others are more cautious. Rosenblatt Securities recently offered a $106 target which is less than 10% upside. Whether Amazon soars or merely inches higher from here will depend on two questions: 1) will inflation and rates cool enough to spur a significant revival in online shopping activity, and 2) will an improved economic outlook push more enterprises to spend on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure?", "And that is the fundamental problem with its one-trick-pony business model.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

These new retail locations mark a significant expansion in India that will offer great new ways to browse, discover, and buy Apple products with exceptional service and experiences for customers.

The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp.
