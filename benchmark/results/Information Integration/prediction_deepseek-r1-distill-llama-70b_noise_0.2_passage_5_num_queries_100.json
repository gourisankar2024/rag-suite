He had close to a hundred sacks and all kinds of other statistics. But as Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said, “Stats are for losers, man.” Donald didn’t want any more stats. He wanted the ring, a championship, the one that eluded him three years earlier when the Rams lost to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. “I know what it feels like to be there, but I don’t know what it feels like to win,” Donald said last week.

In looking at the past through this lens, we can consider the aesthetic and cultural impact of fashion on historical aspects of American life.” Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, said: “American fashion has traditionally been described through the language of sportswear and ready-to-wear, emphasizing principles of simplicity, practicality, functionality, and egalitarianism.  Generally denied the emotional rhetoric applied to European fashion, American fashion has evolved a vernacular that tends to sit in direct opposition to that of the haute couture."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz. So far he has won five tournaments this year, including ATP Masters 1000s in Miami and Madrid.

It is where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, got married, and where Philip's funeral was held. Once her coffin arrives, at approximately 4 p.m. local (11 a.m. Eastern) a televised committal service will take place. The cameras will then be switched off for a private service to be held later in the evening for members of the royal family, at around 7:30 p.m. local (2:30 p.m. Eastern). The queen's funeral is expected to be one of the largest gatherings of royalty and politicians in the U.K. in decades.

Let awards season begin!  NBC will be hosting the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards in 2023. The network has been hosting the award ceremony since 1996, which recognizes the best and brightest in film and television, as selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.  “We recognize the HFPA’s commitment to ongoing change and look forward to welcoming back the Golden Globes to NBC for its landmark 80th anniversary in January 2023,” Frances Berwick, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming’s Chairman of Entertainment Networks, said in a statement.  Here's what to know about the 2023 Golden Globes: Tuesday, January 10, 2023.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies. His HBO special “Rothaniel,” in which he came out as gay, won an Emmy and was considered among the best of 2022.", "Stepping away from the brink of cancellation after two years of tumult, the rebooted Golden Globes ceremony  returns to the small screen Tuesday night.  The show was pushed out of the mainstream awards cycle last year after a Los Angeles Times investigation uncovered questionable self-dealing, ethical lapses and a lack of diversity among members of its parent organization, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.   Awards  Winners of the 2023 Golden Globes include “House of the Dragon,” “Fabelmans,” “Abbott Elementary” and “The Banshees of Inisherin.”   The 80th Golden Globe Awards — which honors projects across film and television  and typically kicks off the awards season — will air at 5 p.m. Pacific Tuesday on NBC and will be streamed on the network’s premium Peacock service. The show will take place at its usual haunt, the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.  In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes’ return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show’s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?    NBC dropped the 2022 Globes broadcast  after a contingent of powerful publicists boycotted the organization and some studios — including Netflix and WarnerMedia — cut ties after The Times’ investigation.", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

Nobel prizes in the hard sciences are generally given for one important piece of research; economics Nobels are typically more like lifetime achievement awards.

The 42-year-old former treasury chief is the country's third premier in under two months, the youngest leader since 1812, and the first person of color to serve in the role. He is of Indian heritage and Hindu faith. \"Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin's war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains the world over,\" Sunak said in his first address as prime minister outside the PM's residence at Number 10 Downing Street. He paid tribute to his predecessor, Liz Truss, but said \"some mistakes were made,\" and that he had been chosen by lawmakers in his party, \"in part, to fix them.\" Sunak, who used to work in finance, is — alongside his wife, tech heiress Akshata Murty — one of the wealthiest people in the U.K. and served as treasury secretary under Boris Johnson.

He is the first British Asian prime minister. He previously held two cabinet positions under Boris Johnson, lastly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022. Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015.  Sunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.  Sunak was elected to the House of Commons for Richmond in North Yorkshire at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum.", "[172] She said she would cancel a planned rise in corporation tax and reverse the recent increase in National Insurance rates, funded by delaying the date by which the national debt is planned to fall, as part of a \"long-term plan to bring down the size of the state and the tax burden\".[173]  On 20 July, Truss and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak were chosen by Conservative Party MPs to be put forward to the membership for the final leadership vote. She finished second in the final MPs ballot, receiving 113 votes to Sunak's 137 votes.[174][175] In the membership vote, it was announced on 5 September that 57.4% of ballots were for Truss, making her the new leader.[175]  As the elected Leader of the Conservative Party, the majority party in the House of Commons, Truss was appointed the new prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle on 6 September 2022.[176]  Truss began appointing her cabinet and to other government positions on 6 September 2022.[177] With the appointment of Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor of the Exchequer, James Cleverly as foreign secretary, and Suella Braverman as home secretary, for the first time in British political history, no white men held positions in the Great Offices of State.[178]", "Watch CBS News              By Haley Ott             September 6, 2022 / 7:51 AM           / CBS News          London — Liz Truss officially became Britain's new prime minister on Tuesday after Boris Johnson formally resigned to Queen Elizabeth II at her home in Balmoral, Scotland, and the monarch accepted Truss as the new leader, inviting her to form a government. The process was largely a formality, to make official the results of an internal power struggle in one of Britain's main political parties. Johnson's three-year tenure was peppered with scandals, which eventually resulted in his ouster. So, who is the woman the Conservative Party has chosen to replace him? Like Johnson, 47-year-old Truss is a member of Britain's Conservative party. She has served as a member of the British Parliament for 12 years and held cabinet roles within various Conservative governments for eight years, serving most recently as Foreign Secretary. Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.  She takes over the premiership as the country faces that, and a number of other significant challenges, including sky-rocketing energy prices driven by the war in Ukraine.", "We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

I remember reading that Netflix has different tiers, and recently they introduced an ad-supported plan. Let me go through the document step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the Basic plan with Ads is mentioned as Netflix’s cheapest plan at $6.99 a month. That's in the first paragraph. Then later, it says the ad-supported tier, called Standard with ads, costs $7 a month. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The initial part refers to Basic with Ads as $6.99, but later it's called Standard with Ads at $7. Maybe there's a name change or a typo.\n\nLooking further, it mentions that the ad-supported plan costs $7 a month, which is cheaper than competitors like Disney Plus and HBO Max, which are $10. So, the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Standard with Ads is $7? Or maybe the names were updated. Let me check again.\n\nIn the document, it says, \"Basic with Ads is Netflix’s cheapest plan at $6.99 a month.\" Then later, it refers to \"Standard with ads (formerly it was Basic with ads).\" Oh, so they changed the name from Basic with Ads to Standard with Ads, but the price is now $7. So, the current plan is Standard with Ads at $7, and the old Basic without Ads is still around, but perhaps being phased out.\n\nWait, no, the document also mentions that the Basic plan without ads is still available, but it's more expensive. It says, \"For $15.49 a month, you get to stream on up to two screens at once. With the Standard subscription plan, you also get access to full HD streaming.\" Wait, that's the Standard plan without ads. So, the Basic without Ads is cheaper than that.\n\nWait, no, the Basic without Ads is $9.99, as mentioned later: \"the same plan without ads costs $9.99.\" So, Basic with Ads is $6.99, and Basic without Ads is $9.99. But then it says the Standard plan is $15.49, which is without ads and allows two screens. So, the Basic without Ads at $9.99 allows only one screen and 720p, while the Basic with Ads is $6.99, also one screen but with ads.\n\nSo, to answer the question: How much do the Netflix Basic with Ads and without Ads subscriptions cost? The Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99. The document seems to have some inconsistencies because it mentions both Basic and Standard with Ads, but clarifies that the ad-supported plan was formerly Basic with Ads and is now Standard with Ads, but the price is $7. However, the initial part of the document refers to Basic with Ads as $6.99. There's a bit of confusion here.\n\nWait, let me parse this again. The document states: \"Basic with Ads is Netflix’s cheapest plan at $6.99 a month.\" Then later, it says: \"Netflix also said the number of people who've signed up for the ad-tier plan has more than doubled since the start of 2023. Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022. It costs less than similar plans from other streaming services, like Disney Plus and HBO Max (soon to be called just Max). These other ad-supported tiers cost $10 a month while Netflix's costs $7 a month.\"\n\nSo, the ad-supported tier is $7 a month, but earlier it was called Basic with Ads at $6.99. Maybe the document has conflicting information. Also, it says: \"The ad-supported tier launched in November 2022. Netflix said Wednesday at its 2023 Upfront presentation that almost 5 million people are using the service's ad-supported tier, called Standard with ads (formerly it was Basic with ads).\" So, the ad-supported plan was called Basic with Ads when it launched but was later renamed to Standard with Ads, but the price is $7.\n\nWait, but the initial part says the Basic with Ads is $6.99. So, perhaps there's a mistake. Let me see: the document says the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the ad-supported tier (now called Standard with Ads) is $7. So, maybe the Basic with Ads was $6.99 when it was called Basic, and now it's $7 as Standard with Ads. But that doesn't make sense because the Standard plan is a higher tier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the document has a typo. Let me check the prices again. It says: \"The Standard plan costs $15.49 per month – $8.50 more than the cheapest plan currently available.\" So, the cheapest plan is $6.99 (Basic with Ads), and the Standard without Ads is $15.49. Then, it mentions the Basic plan without Ads is $9.99: \"the same plan without ads costs $9.99.\" So, the Basic without Ads is $9.99, and the Basic with Ads is $6.99.\n\nSo, to sum up, the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99. The Standard with Ads is $7, but that seems conflicting because the Standard plan without Ads is $15.49. Maybe the ad-supported tier is called Standard with Ads at $7, but the Basic without Ads is $9.99. So, perhaps the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99, while the Standard with Ads is $7, which is a separate tier.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the plans as per the document:\n\n- Basic with Ads: $6.99 (cheapest)\n- Basic without Ads: $9.99\n- Standard without Ads: $15.49\n- Premium: $19.99\n\nAdditionally, the ad-supported tier is called Standard with Ads at $7, but that might be a different tier or a renaming. But the document says that the ad-supported tier was formerly Basic with Ads and is now Standard with Ads, priced at $7. So, perhaps the current ad-supported plan is Standard with Ads at $7, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99.\n\nBut the initial part of the document says Basic with Ads is $6.99. So, perhaps the document has conflicting information. Maybe the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Standard with Ads is $7, but that would mean two ad-supported tiers, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Basic with Ads was $6.99, and after the name change, it's now called Standard with Ads at $7. So, the current ad-supported plan is $7, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99.\n\nI think the correct answer is that the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99. The Standard with Ads is $7, but that might be a separate tier or an error. However, the document seems to indicate that the ad-supported plan is $7, so maybe the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Standard with Ads is $7. But that would be two different plans, which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Standard without Ads is $15.49. The ad-supported tier is now called Standard with Ads at $7, but the Basic without Ads is $9.99.\n\nWait, the document says: \"The ad-supported tier launched in November 2022.

It's more likely that the ad-supported plan is $6.99, and the next tier without ads is $9.99.\n\nSo, to answer the question: The Netflix Basic with Ads subscription costs $6.99 a month, and the Basic without Ads costs $9.99 a month.\n</think>\n\nThe Netflix Basic with Ads subscription costs $6.99 per month, while the Basic without Ads subscription costs $9.99 per month.", "docs": ["Downloaded shows and movies will expire after a certain amount of time, depending on the title—some will self-delete after 48 hours, but most will remain for at least a week or longer.

Netflix’s Basic plan only allows streaming on a single device in 720p resolution. The Standard plan works with two devices simultaneously at 1080p resolution, while the Premium plan enables up to four devices simultaneously at 4K resolution. It’s uncertain at this point whether Netflix plans to discontinue the ad-free basic tier. When Netflix introduced its Basic plan with ads, the company also revealed that the new cheaper plan wouldn’t be available for Apple TV users. More than a month later, the situation is the same.

{"id": 53, "query": "Which party controls the house and the senate after the 2022 midterm elections?", "ans": ["Republican ", "Democrats"], "label": [1, 1], "prediction": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out which party controls the House and the Senate after the 2022 midterm elections. Let me go through the provided documents step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the BBC document, it mentions that the House decides which laws are voted on, and the Senate can block or approve them. It also talks about the midterm elections being every two years, with all House seats and one-third of the Senate up for election. It notes that in the 2022 midterms, all House seats and one-third of the Senate were contested. However, the BBC document doesn't specify the outcome in terms of party control.\n\nMoving on to the next document, it states that as of November 16, 2022, Republican Kevin McCarthy is likely to become House Speaker when the new Congress convenes. That suggests that Republicans won the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe third document details the Senate composition. It mentions that after the runoff elections in January 2021, Democrats had 50 seats, Republicans 50, with two Independents caucusing with Democrats, giving them a majority via Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote. However, this is about the 117th Congress, not the 118th. The document then shows the 118th Congress (2023–2025) with 48 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and 3 Independents. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the document says: \"118th Congress (2023–2025) Majority Party: Democrats (48 seats) Minority Party: Republicans (49 seats) Other Parties: 3 Independents Total Seats: 100\". Hmm, that can't be right because 48 Democrats + 49 Republicans + 3 Independents equals 100, but in the Senate, each party can't have more than 50. Maybe it's a typo. Perhaps it's 48 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and 3 Independents who caucus with Democrats, making the majority. But that would be 51 for Democrats, which doesn't align with the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the document is incorrect. Because in reality, after the 2022 midterms, the Senate remained in Democratic control with 51 seats (including the new Georgia seat won by Warnock). Let me cross-reference this.\n\nLooking at another part of the document, it mentions that in the 2022 midterms, Democrats defended 14 Senate seats, and the document later talks about the 118th Congress. However, the numbers in the document seem off. It says Democrats have 48, Republicans 49, and 3 Independents. That would make 100 seats, but that's impossible because the Senate has 100 seats, with two from each state. If it's 48D, 49R, and 3I, that's 100. But typically, Independents caucus with one party, so if the 3 Independents caucus with Democrats, that would make 51 Democrats, giving them the majority. However, the document says \"Majority Party: Democrats (48 seats)\", which doesn't add up. There must be an error in the document.\n\nAnother part of the document mentions that after the 2020 runoff, Democrats had 50 seats, Republicans 50, with two Independents caucusing with Democrats. So, going into the 2022 midterms, Democrats had 50 seats (including the two Independents). They defended 14 seats. The document doesn't specify the outcome, but I know historically that in the 2022 midterms, the Senate remained Democratic with 51 seats because they won in Nevada and Georgia, for example.\n\nSo, putting it together, the House went to Republicans, and the Senate stayed with Democrats after the 2022 midterms.\n</think>\n\nAfter the 2022 midterm elections, the House of Representatives was controlled by the Republican Party, while the Senate remained under Democratic control.

Partisan seat swings in midterm elections are consistently correlated with two factors:  Approval: President Biden’s approval ratings have been in the low 40% range for most of 2022. The most recent data (as of this writing) show an approval rate of 44%. In our graphs, one can see the typical positive association between approval and seat loss/gain in both the House and Senate. In both instances the correlation is moderately strong:  r= 0.61 for the House, r = 0.45 for the Senate. From 1936-2018, near the midterms, six presidents have had approval ratings in the range of 40-45%--like Biden. Those cases involved wide variation in seat loss or gain. The range of outcomes in the Senate was between -9 and +2  seats. The average was a loss of 4. In the House, presidents with approval between 40-45%, saw their party lose between 63 and 13 seats, with an average loss of 36 seats. There have been no instances of House seat gains for Presidents with approval as low as Biden’s.

However, when breaking down the 2020 election results further, the number of districts that Trump won by more than 15 points goes from 132 under old maps to 143 under new maps. Under new district lines, there are only 33 districts that either Trump or Biden won by fewer than five percentage points.

With Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly’s victory in Arizona on Friday, Democrats now hold a 50-49 edge in the Senate. The party will retain control of the chamber, no matter how next month’s Georgia runoff plays out, by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote. Democrats’ hold on the Senate is a blow to Republicans’ high hopes of wresting away control of Congress in a midterm election that typically favors the party out of power. It was still unclear which party would control the House of Representatives as counting continued in razor-tight races in California and a smattering of other states. Cortez Masto, the first Latina in the Senate, was considered the most vulnerable Democratic senator in the midterm elections, and the Republican Party had high hopes of flipping the seat.", "A perennial battleground for many years, the state has been shifting red.

Florida has experienced a high number of early voters who cast their ballots ahead of Election Day. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican darling and potential 2024 contender, is up for reelection against Democrat Charlie Crist. DeSantis has been front and center of the Republican Party's culture wars, enacting controversial policies on COVID, imposing restrictions on discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in the classroom, implementing an electoral fraud unit and funding migrant flights. Crist has offered himself to voters as a \"commonsense\" uniter who wouldn't take away rights, such as abortion access. While the 2018 midterms featured incredibly close races, including the governor's contest between DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum, the state has become redder since then. At the end of September, Republicans had a lead of more than 290,000 voters. In the U.S. Senate race, Republican incumbent Marco Rubio is facing off against Democrat Val Demings.

It could take several days or more before the outcome of enough House races are known to determine which party will hold the majority in the 435-seat chamber. Republicans continued to have an edge, but returns were still flowing in for several races, including many in liberal-leaning California. Biden, speaking in Cambodia, said his party would be focused on winning the Georgia Senate race but regarding the prospect of keeping control of the House he said: \"It's a stretch.\" House Republicans, should they prevail, have pledged to try to roll back Biden victories on battling climate change and want to make permanent a series of 2017 tax cuts that will expire.

I have several documents from December 18, 2022, that mention different figures. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial document says the sequel earned $134 million from North American theaters. That seems pretty straightforward for the U.S. box office. Then, another document mentions that it earned $77 million through its opening weekend. Wait, that's conflicting. So which one is correct? Did it make $134 million or $77 million in the U.S.?\n\nLooking further, I see another document that states the film made $77 million domestically over its first weekend. So that's consistent with the second document. But the first document says $134 million. Hmm, maybe the $134 million is the total after some days, not just the opening weekend. Or perhaps one of them is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to the worldwide earnings, one document says International markets gave $301 million, leading to a total of $435 million globally. Another document confirms that the film earned $435 million in its first weekend worldwide, with 80% from 3D showings. So that part is consistent.\n\nPutting it together, it seems that in the U.S., the opening weekend was $77 million, and internationally it was $301 million, totaling $378 million. But wait, another document says the total was $435 million. That doesn't add up because 77 + 301 is 378, not 435. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the $134 million is the U.S. total, and $301 million is international, making the worldwide total $435 million. But another document says the U.S. opening was $77 million, which would mean international was $358 million to reach $435 million. That's conflicting.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the U.S. figure is just the opening weekend or includes more days. The documents mention both $77 million and $134 million for the U.S., which is confusing. I'll have to determine which one is the correct opening weekend figure.\n\nSince multiple documents mention $77 million as the domestic opening weekend, I'll go with that. Then, the international would be $435 million total minus $77 million domestic, which is $358 million. But another document says international was $301 million, so that's a discrepancy. It's possible that one document is incorrect, or maybe the $435 million includes more than just the weekend.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, I need to decide which figures are more reliable. The $77 million domestic and $301 million international leading to $378 million worldwide don't match the $435 million total mentioned elsewhere. This inconsistency suggests that some documents might have errors.\n\nI think the accurate answer is that the U.S. opening weekend was $77 million, international was $301 million, totaling $378 million. However, since one document states the worldwide total as $435 million, there's a contradiction. To resolve this, I'll note that there are factual errors in the provided documents because the numbers don't consistently add up across all sources.\n</think>\n\nThere are factual errors in the provided documents. The correct answer, based on consistent information, is that \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" earned $77 million in its debut weekend at the U.S. box office and $301 million internationally, totaling $378 million worldwide. However, there is a discrepancy as one document mentions a worldwide total of $435 million, indicating inconsistent reporting.\n\nAnswer: There are factual errors in the provided documents.

He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Microsoft is introducing a new consumer tier to its Microsoft 365 subscription offerings. Priced at just $1.99 per month, Microsoft 365 Basic is designed to replace the 100GB OneDrive storage option with some extra features that sit in between the free option and the $6.99 a month Personal subscription. Microsoft 365 Basic will be available worldwide on January 30th with 100GB of cloud storage, an ad-free Outlook web and mobile experience, and enhanced security features. The security features include data encryption for an Outlook mailbox, suspicious link checking, and virus / malware scanning for attachments. Existing OneDrive 100GB storage customers will be automatically upgraded to Microsoft 365 Basic at the same $1.99 monthly rate. “Later this year, we’ll have a bunch of stuff with OneDrive advanced security that will be available as well, that includes Personal Vault, password-protected and expiring links, ransomware detection and recovery, and bulk file restore,” says Gareth Oystryk, director of product marketing for Microsoft 365, in an interview with The Verge.

Basic subscribers will have to use the web or mobile versions instead. “We know many people are using our services today, but some of them run out of storage or want additional benefits that you don’t get with the free Microsoft 365 experience,” says Oystryk. “We also designed this specifically with Windows users in mind.” The Microsoft 365 Basic package is aimed at Windows users that need extra storage but also feels like Microsoft’s way of familiarizing people with its productivity subscriptions. “Is the Office brand going away entirely? No.” Microsoft is also renaming its Office app on mobile and Windows to Microsoft 365 later this month. It reflects the branding changes Microsoft announced last year, where Microsoft Office will largely be referred to as Microsoft 365 going forward. “Is the Office brand going away entirely?

This is a grimier entry, more likely to break with convention — one where the white mask of its serial killer Ghostface is scuffed up. The character’s physicality is also steadier, more willing to be still, with the occasional Michael Myers head tilt. Moving from the well-appointed and brightly lit homes of small towns and the suburbs to the dark alleys of New York sounded like a desperate move (see “Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan”), but placing stalker sequences in crowds inspired some fresh thinking. There are a couple of truly frightening, patiently established suspense scenes, including one inside a subway car during Halloween that’s filled with people in costumes of horror villains, including multiple Ghostfaces. It’s a nicely staged vignette that, in keeping with the spirit of “Scream,” operates as a meta commentary on the glut of scary movies.

The makers of that fine-enough 2019 franchise-starter, including director David F. Sandberg, toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and post-Spielberg sentimentality that’s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style super-projects that dominate the landscape. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” meanders further in that direction. The first “Shazam!” works as well as it does because it’s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. “Shazam!

ChatGPT inspired new start-ups, captured the public imagination and prompted greater competition between Google and Microsoft, he said, adding, “Now that market demand has shifted, Google’s approach has, too.” Last week, OpenAI tried to up the ante with newer technology called GPT-4, which will allow other businesses to build the kind of artificial intelligence that powers ChatGPT into a variety of products, including business software and e-commerce websites. Google has been testing the technology underlying Bard since 2015, but has so far not released it beyond a small group of early testers because, like the chatbots offered by OpenAI and Microsoft, it does not always generate trustworthy information and can show bias against women and people of color. “We are well aware of the issues; we need to bring this to market responsibly,” said Eli Collins, Google’s vice president for research. “At the same time, we see all the excitement in the industry and the excitement of all the people using generative A.I.” Mr."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google’s latest Photos trick is a feature it’s calling Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to let you make major edits to a photo without professional tools. The company revealed the feature at Google I/O 2023. Google shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo, erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo, which generates “new” parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It’s impressive stuff — and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser. It’s also not quite perfect given leftover artifacts like creases from the bag strap in the waterfall photo and a misplaced shadow under the bench in the second.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  One of the most impressive demos at Google I/O started with a photo of a woman in front of a waterfall. A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It’s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents — and potentially, the meaning — of a photo in much more significant ways.

The question is asking about the ChatGPT API, which I believe is the official one from OpenAI. I recall that OpenAI released the ChatGPT API in March 2023, but the document here is from Software AG.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point.

Then, I come across a part that mentions Jessie Diggins. It says she won her second Olympic medal, taking third place in the women's cross-country skiing individual sprint free event. This medal is a bronze. It also notes that she became the first American to win a medal in a cross-country skiing individual sprint event. \n\nLooking further, another document mentions that Jessie Diggins left Beijing as the most decorated American cross-country skier of all time. It also states that she finished in the top 10 in all six women's cross-country skiing events. Additionally, it notes that she won another medal, making it her second medal in the 2022 Olympics. \n\nWait, so she won two medals? The first one was bronze in the individual sprint, and the second one might be in another event. The document also mentions that in PyeongChang 2018, she won a gold medal in the team sprint. However, the focus here is on Beijing 2022. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of a second medal in Beijing. The document says she won her second Olympic medal, implying she won one in Beijing and another previously. But another part says she left Beijing as the most decorated, so maybe she won two medals in Beijing. Wait, the document says she won her second Olympic medal in Beijing, so perhaps she had one from a previous Olympics and one from Beijing. \n\nWait, no, the initial part says she won her second Olympic medal at Beijing 2022, which was the bronze. Then, in another part, it says she won her second 2022 Olympic medal, which suggests she won two medals in Beijing. So, she won two medals in Beijing: one bronze in the individual sprint and another in a different event. \n\nLooking again, the second document mentions that she won her second medal in Beijing, but it doesn't specify the event. It just says she overcame an equipment issue and won by 2 seconds in the quarterfinals. The other medal might be from another event, possibly the team sprint or another individual race. \n\nWait, but in the first document, it says she became the first American to win a medal in the individual sprint, which was bronze. The second document mentions she won her second medal, but doesn't specify which event. However, the first document also talks about her being the most decorated, finishing top 10 in all six events, but that doesn't necessarily mean she won six medals. \n\nI think I might be mixing up information. Let me clarify: in Beijing 2022, Jessie Diggins won a bronze medal in the individual sprint. The second document mentions she won her second medal in Beijing, so she must have won another one, possibly in another event. \n\nWait, perhaps the second medal was in the team sprint again, as she did in PyeongChang 2018. But the documents don't explicitly state that. The first document says she won bronze in the individual sprint, and the second document says she won her second medal, but doesn't specify the event. \n\nI might need to piece this together. Since she won two medals in Beijing, one being bronze in the individual sprint, the other could be in another event, maybe the team sprint or the 10km freestyle. However, the documents don't specify the second event, only that she won a second medal. \n\nSo, to answer the question, Jessie Diggins won two medals in Beijing 2022: one bronze in the individual sprint and another medal, possibly in a different event, but the exact event isn't specified in the provided documents. \n\nWait, no, the second document says she won her second Olympic medal, which was in Beijing. So, in Beijing, she won two medals: bronze in individual sprint and another medal, perhaps silver or gold, in another event. But the documents don't specify the second event. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second medal was in the team sprint, as she did before, but the documents don't mention that. So, based on the information given, she won at least one medal, bronze, in the individual sprint, and possibly a second medal in another event. \n\nBut I should check all the documents again. The first document about her mentions she won bronze in the individual sprint. The second document says she won her second medal, but without details. So, the answer is that she won a bronze medal in the individual sprint and another medal, but the second one isn't specified in the documents. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the medals she won in Beijing 2022, and the documents only explicitly mention the bronze in the individual sprint. The part about her being the most decorated might refer to her overall career, not just Beijing. \n\nSo, to avoid confusion, I'll state that she won a bronze medal in the women's cross-country skiing individual sprint free event. The other mention of a second medal in Beijing isn't clear, so I should stick to the explicit information. \n\nTherefore, Jessie Diggins won a bronze medal in the individual sprint event at the Beijing 2022 Olympics.\n</think>\n\nJessie Diggins won a bronze medal in the women's cross-country skiing individual sprint free event at the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games. The documents do not specify if she won additional medals in Beijing, so the confirmed medal is the bronze in the individual sprint. \n\nAnswer: Jessie Diggins won a bronze medal in the women's cross-country skiing individual sprint free event at the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games.", "docs": ["Lindsey Jacobellis reacts after the women's individual snowboard cross final during the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 on February 9, 2022 in Beijing.   February 9, 2022: After over a decade of dominating the sport of snowboard cross but coming up just short in Olympic competition, legendary snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis earned her first gold medal in the fast-paced event.
