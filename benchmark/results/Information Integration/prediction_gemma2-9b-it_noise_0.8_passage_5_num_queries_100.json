The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago.

The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl. Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more information on the five performers,  click here  . The national anthem singer for 2022 will be Mickey Guyton.

After last year's contest in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the Super Bowl heads out west to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, for Super Bowl 56. From then on, the Super Bowl will continue to be held in dome stadiums for a while. Each of the next three announced venues will have a roof over the heads of the fans and players, and will be in warmer weather areas, as is typical of the Super Bowl. Sporting News has you covered with all you need to know about the location of this year's Super Bowl, as well as the host site in future years. This year's Super Bowl will be held at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The home of the Rams and the Chargers, SoFi Stadium was originally set to host the Super Bowl in 2021, however its opening was delayed until 2020, and NFL rules dictate that a stadium has to be open for at least two seasons before it can host the title game. This will be the third time the city has hosted the Super Bowl, with the L.A. Memorial Coliseum having hosted it twice (1967, 1973).

Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic.

By Nico Grant Even Alphabet, the parent company of Google and one of the internet’s most entrenched businesses, was not immune to the punishing blows of the global economy and a sharp slowdown in the online advertising that is essential to the company’s profits. Alphabet on Tuesday reported a net profit of $13.9 billion in the third quarter, down 27 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbed 6 percent to $69.1 billion. The earnings fell short of analysts’ estimates of $16.9 billion in profit on $71 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by FactSet. Since Alphabet last released financial results in July, the global economy has worsened, with rising inflation and interest rates as well as slowing growth prompting fears that even tech giants like Google’s parent, insulated by their popular products and piles of cash, would feel some financial pain. Those worries were realized in Tuesday’s results, which signaled that the online ad market was slowing as advertisers slashed budgets. Alphabet executives said on a call with analysts that they had seen less ad spending for insurance, loans, mortgages and crypto, as well as fewer gaming ads.

The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat. And maybe that’s the point.", "True crime podcasts have swiftly gone from a fringe hobby to a booming business, spurring not only a slew of shows, much merch, and a hit TV comedy series, but also a lot of questions about the ethics of civilians poking their noses into real-life tragedies. Everyone wants to be a hero. But what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.  Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day…and promote herself.  Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat, she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make people underestimate her. She seems childish for a college student and ridiculous as an investigator. But!", "Sep 9, 2022 ...

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad.

Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

Although the shooter denied political motivations, he told police the attack had been planned for months. Abe was shot from behind in the western city of Nara while speaking at a campaign event ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections. Police arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, at the scene. Yamagami, an unemployed former sailor in Japan's maritime armed forces, confessed to the assassination in which he used a handmade firearm, according to police.   Police said Yamagami told them that he went to Okayama, another western city, where Abe was giving another campaign speech the day before the shooting, according to Kyodo News, which cited \"investigative sources.\" Yamagami denied any political motivations for the assassination, according to police.

Japan’s longest serving prime minister, he was also perhaps the most polarizing, complex politician in recent Japanese history. Abe, who was assassinated Friday, angered both liberals at home and World War II victims in Asia with his hawkish push to revamp the military and his revisionist view that Japan was given an unfair verdict by history for its brutal past. At the same time, he revitalized Japan’s economy, led efforts for the nation to take a stronger role in Asia and served as a rare beacon of political stability before stepping down two years ago for health reasons. “He’s the most towering political figure in Japan over the past couple of decades,” said Dave Leheny, a political scientist at Waseda University. “He wanted Japan to be respected on the global stage in the way that he felt was deserved. ... He also wanted Japan to not have to keep apologizing for World War II.” Abe, who died after being shot during a campaign speech, was 67.", "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his “deepest condolences” to former leader Abe, saying he “was a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time.”           Kishida said he had a “great respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind” and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs.           News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.

Nobel prizes in the hard sciences are generally given for one important piece of research; economics Nobels are typically more like lifetime achievement awards.

He is the first British Asian prime minister. He previously held two cabinet positions under Boris Johnson, lastly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022. Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015.  Sunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.

Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party.

Florida voters on Tuesday will cast their ballots for several key elections this cycle, including the governor's race and races for the U.S. Senate and House. Once a perennial swing state, Florida has been shifting more red over recent cycles. Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. ET. Florida has experienced a high number of early voters who cast their ballots ahead of Election Day. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican darling and potential 2024 contender, is up for reelection against Democrat Charlie Crist. DeSantis has been front and center of the Republican Party's culture wars, enacting controversial policies on COVID, imposing restrictions on discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in the classroom, implementing an electoral fraud unit and funding migrant flights. Crist has offered himself to voters as a \"commonsense\" uniter who wouldn't take away rights, such as abortion access. While the 2018 midterms featured incredibly close races, including the governor's contest between DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum, the state has become redder since then. At the end of September, Republicans had a lead of more than 290,000 voters. In the U.S. Senate race, Republican incumbent Marco Rubio is facing off against Democrat Val Demings. Demings, a three-term congresswoman and former police chief, is running to become the state's first Black senator.", "Advertisement Last updated Nov. 22, 2022 Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who is seen as vulnerable, is being challenged by Adam Laxalt, a former attorney general who helped lead former President Donald J.

Her victory allows the Democrats to retain control the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote even without a victory in the Georgia runoff in December. Cortez Masto benefited in mail ballot counting since Election Day, winning in Clark County, which accounts for three-quarters of Nevada’s population. Laxalt saw his lead of some 19,000 votes after election night dwindle to nearly 900 on Saturday before the latest counted votes were added to the tally.  The AP determined Cortez Masto’s lead would carry through additional updates in Reno’s Washoe County as well as among provisional and “cured” ballots, or those with signature or date issues. Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.  In elections from 2014 to 2018, more than half the total vote came from people who voted early in person or delivered absentee ballots.  Those categories accounted for nearly 90% of the vote in 2020’s presidential election.  The counties to watch are Clark (anchored by Las Vegas) and Washoe (which includes Reno)."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

As for the line-up of Ken dolls, as well as Gosling, of course, three-time Emmy winner Will Ferrell is joined by the likes of Marvel's Simu Liu, new Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, One Night in Miami...'s Kingsley Ben-Adir, and Grace and Frankie's Scott Evans.  Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'

Plus, a first look at the cuteness.   Eeeeek! It’s happening: the Barbie movie is officially on the way. No, we’re not talking about Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses or Barbie and the Diamond Castle — we’re getting a real, live-action version featuring Margot Robbie in all of her pink-on-pink glory.  Mattel and Warner Bros. are partnering to bring this ~iconic~ character to life for the first time with Margot Robbie both starring in and producing the film. That's a GirlBoss™ if we've ever seen one, which is fitting because Barbie herself has clocked hours at over 200 jobs, according to Mattel. Margot spoke to Marc Malkin at Variety, saying that “I think it’s a great opportunity to put some positivity out in the world and a chance to be aspirational for younger kids.”  Warner Bros. released the first teaser image back in May, and spoiler alert, it’s completely adorable. We’re screaming, crying, and throwing up over Barbie's bright pink convertible in this brand new sneak peek photo — and predicting a huge resurgence of pink fashion in the near future (tiny plastic shoes not included).

It was uninspiring.” Speculation about Robbie’s casting as Barbie first began in 2015, after a Sony email leak reportedly revealed that she was among the actresses potentially being considered to play the famous doll. Years later, in October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Robbie was in talks to star in and produce the film with Warner Bros.  She also wasn’t the only star attached to the film. In 2016, Amy Schumer had reportedly landed the role but dropped out a few months later due to scheduling conflicts, according to THR. In 2017, Anne Hathaway was  reported to possibly star.  Greta Gerwig has been attached to the Barbie flick since 2019, when she was confirmed to write the script with Noah Baumbach. Now, the Little Women filmmaker is set to direct the film as well, as sources have confirmed to Variety. (Robbie mentioned it in a recent interview as well.) Fans will have to wait a couple years to see this film come to life.", "“The conversation has kept evolving. I think ultimately it is a conversation we’re having about ourselves, but it’s easy to put it on Barbie.” Robbie along with her Ken, Ryan Gosling, and I were speaking in Beverly Hills a few weeks before the film opens on July 21, a date that has turned into a gender battle at the box office between “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical drama about the making of the atomic bomb, “Oppenheimer.” That hasn’t stopped Robbie and Gosling from vibrating with excitement over what they’ve created and the deep understanding their writer-director Greta Gerwig had for the material. (Gerwig co-wrote the script with her partner, Noah Baumbach.) Gosling compared her work to Warhol’s Campbell’s soup can: “It’s like showing you this thing that you’ve seen a million times as art,” he said. “Once I read the script, I felt like I was seeing all these things that were around me in a completely new and deep and hilarious way.” Gerwig in an email likened her stars to “top-flight race cars just hanging out and sometimes racing, but just for fun,” and added “I think they were both just delighted by the other.” In our conversation Robbie and Gosling spoke about Friday-night script readings with Mattel executives, how Ken is regarded in the Gosling household and leaning in to the thorny aspects of Barbie.

This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid).

Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers.

Whether it’s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. It’s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help people. That’s the journey we’ve been on with large language models.", "From imagining the prime minister leading a cabinet meeting about war to a guide on how best to start your own podcast, Google's LaMDA AI is certainly flexible. By  Tom Acres, technology reporter   Saturday 5 November 2022 19:41, UK The scene is 10 Downing Street, the home of the prime minister. It's a crisp, cool day. A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman! Now, before anyone gets any ideas, the setup to this particular story is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI. The presentation included how they were exploring whether LaMDA could generate videos, realistic speech, and even write fiction.                    Is this the future of comedy?

Baidu is seen as a leader in a race in China among tech giants and startups to develop a rival to Microsoft (MSFT.O) ChatGPT, which took the world by storm after showcasing the power of so-called generative AI, which can create new text, imagery and other content based on inputs from past data. The company's Ernie bot is based off its AI-driven deep learning model, Ernie - short for \"Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration\". During the presentation at Baidu's Beijing headquarters that was also livestreamed over nine platforms, Li cautioned it was not perfect. \"So why are we unveiling it today?

Why trust us? These days, Google is all-in on AI, and Google Bard is its flagship product. It’s an AI chatbot, and it’s very much meant to be a rival to the ever-popular ChatGPT. And while it does replicate a lot of what ChatGPT does, Google has become highly invested in this space and has already made some significant updates to the tool that take it beyond what ChatGPT can do. Like ChatGPT, Google Bard is a conversational AI chatbot that can generate text of all kinds. You can ask it any question, as long as it doesn’t violate its content policies, Bard will provide an answer. Although Bard hasn’t officially replaced Google Assistant, it’s a far more powerful AI assistant. That’s because it’s based on Google’s own LLM (Large Language Model), known as LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). Like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, the model behind ChatGPT, the engineers at Google have trained LaMDA on hundreds of billions of parameters, letting the AI “learn” natural language on its own. The result is a chatbot that can answer any question in surprisingly natural and conversational language. LaMDA was originally announced at Google I/O in 2021, but it remained a prototype and was never released to the public.", "ChatGPT’s meteoric rise in popularity has reportedly prompted Google’s management to declare a “code red” situation for its search product.

Google’s event came one day after rival Microsoft announced a revamped version of Bing powered by a more advanced version of the AI used by ChatGPT. (Microsoft is investing billions in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.)

And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better.

We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "Mohammad Emad Mostaque (Bengali: মোহম্মদ ইমাদ মোশতাক) is the founder and CEO of Stability AI, one of the companies behind Stable Diffusion.", "As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.  “It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.", "Aug 5, 2022 ...

Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Ke Huy Quan has long been a frontrunner for best supporting actor, so that moment was no surprise. But Angela Bassett was widely considered a likely winner for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos).

Samsung recently brought attention to the power of AI-“enhanced” photos with “Space Zoom,” a feature that’s supposed to let you capture incredible pictures of the Moon on newer Galaxy devices. In March, a Reddit user tried using Space Zoom on an almost unsalvageable image of the Moon and found that Samsung appeared to add craters and other patches that weren’t actually there. Not only does this run the risk of creating a “fake” image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras. As my colleague Allison Johnson points out, mobile photography already fakes a lot of things, whether it’s by applying filters or unblurring a photo, and doctored images are nothing new.

Each team will receive a number of combinations equivalent to their assigned odds of winning the top pick.

The No.1 pick in the draft is awarded to the team that successfully draws the winning four-number combination from the lottery machine. Once a winner is determined, the process is repeated to determine picks two, three and four. Should a team be drawn more than once the result is discarded and a new combination is drawn. The remaining teams are then allocated a pick order based on their regular season record.

This is a well-deserved Nobel Prize. I couldn’t be happier for her.” Cohen said that Bertozzi is also “a great mentor to all of the scientists around her, and has always been an inspirational role model for both women and LGBTQ people in science.” Bertozzi and others have used her methods to answer fundamental questions about the role of sugars in biology, to study how cells build proteins and other molecules, to develop new cancer medicines, and to produce new materials for energy storage, among many other applications.", "© Nobel Prize Outreach.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options.

The extent to which retail spending and digital transformation are on hold won’t be known until Amazon reports Q1 results in late-April. The Street thinks better news and big gains lie ahead.  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a projected gain that’s right behind that of Amazon. The consensus price target is just shy of $130, which means 37% separates Alphabet from its current bogey. It’s upside that seems reasonable considering the online search king is down roughly the same percentage from its February 2022 peak.  Wall Street's unanimously bullish position makes Alphabet a more compelling MATANA pick. Over the past three months, a perfect 32 of 32 firms have called Alphabet stock a ‘buy.’ It's hard to take a contrarian stance when more than two dozen analysts who eat, sleep and breathe the company see Alphabet stock heading higher.  The reset button has effectively been hit for Alphabet after reporting just 2% revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Yes, advertisers have pulled back spending in a weakened economy, but it doesn’t change Google’s command of the search market. As macro conditions improve, ad dollars will return because they have to — 76% of today’s searches happen on Google.  This dominance has the Street expecting a return to double-digit profit growth within the next few years.", "But it is a car company, and in the less than 20 years since it was founded in 2003, it has disrupted the automotive sector. In 2021, Tesla was ranked as the most valuable automotive brand in the world. That same year, it was deemed the fastest growing brand on the planet. Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021. The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock. Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months.", "It’s highly unlikely that this herd of bulls has the long-term forecast wrong.  There’s a big jump down to the MATANA stock with the next best upside, and that’s Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications. The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.", "Apr 19, 2023 ...

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products.
