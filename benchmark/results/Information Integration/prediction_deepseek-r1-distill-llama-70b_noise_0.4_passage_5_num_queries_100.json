Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.", "Every product was carefully curated by an Esquire editor.

It is her third Grand Slam title and first on a surface other than clay. By Matthew Futterman The 2022 U.S. Open will always be remembered — outside of Poland, at least — for its farewell to Serena Williams, long the queen of tennis and the greatest women’s player ever. Beware, though, after Poland’s Iga Swiatek won the women’s singles title Saturday, beating Ons Jabeur of Tunisia Saturday afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the sport may have a new ruler on its hands. Swiatek, the world No. 1, lived up to her billing and beat Jabeur, 6-2, 7-6(5), to capture her first U.S. Open singles title. It was the third Grand Slam title of Swiatek’s brief career and her first on a surface other than clay.

{"id": 22, "query": "Who are the champion of the men's and women's singles at Wimbledon 2022?", "ans": ["Elena Rybakina", "Novak Djokovic"], "label": [-1], "prediction": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out who the champions of the men's and women's singles at Wimbledon were in 2022. Let me look through the provided documents to find the information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the document for mentions of Wimbledon 2022. I see a section that says, \"Jul 9, 2022 ... Wimbledon winner: Elena Rybakina wins women's singles title over Ons Jabeur.\" So, that tells me the women's champion in 2022 was Elena Rybakina. She was the #17 seed and defeated Ons Jabeur, who was the #3 seed. The final was on July 9, 2022, and Rybakina came back from a first set loss to win in three sets.\n\nNow, for the men's singles champion. The document mentions Novak Djokovic defending his title and claiming his 21st major title by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the final. However, I need to check the date to make sure this was in 2022. The document doesn't explicitly state the year for Djokovic's win, but since the women's 2022 final is mentioned, perhaps the men's final was around the same time. Wait, no, the document also includes information about 2023, like Marketa Vondrousova winning the women's title in 2023. So, I need to confirm whether Djokovic won in 2022 or 2023.\n\nLooking closer, the document starts with Djokovic successfully defending his title, but the exact year isn't specified there. However, in the women's section, it's clear that in 2023, Marketa Vondrousova won, while in 2022, Elena Rybakina won. Since Wimbledon is an annual event, the men's champion for 2022 would have been before the 2023 event. I recall that in 2022, Novak Djokovic did win Wimbledon, so that's consistent. The document doesn't mention the 2022 men's final in detail but does talk about Djokovic's 21st title, which I believe was achieved in 2023. Wait, that might be confusing.\n\nWait, no, in reality, Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2022, which was his 21st Grand Slam title. The document seems to mix information from 2022 and 2023. It starts with Djokovic's title, but then later discusses the 2023 women's final. So, perhaps the first part is about 2023, but the second part about Rybakina is from 2022. That's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nThe first paragraph says Djokovic defended his title and won his 21st major, defeating Kyrgios. That was in 2023. Then, the document discusses the 2023 women's final where Vondrousova won. Then, it goes back to 2022, mentioning Rybakina's win. So, the men's 2022 champion isn't directly mentioned in the document. But since the document is about both 2022 and 2023, I need to piece it together.\n\nWait, the question is about 2022, so I need to focus on that. The document explicitly mentions that in 2022, Elena Rybakina won the women's singles. For the men's, the document doesn't explicitly state the 2022 champion, but it does talk about Djokovic winning in 2023. Therefore, perhaps the 2022 men's champion isn't in the document. But from my prior knowledge, I know that Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2022 as well. However, since the document doesn't provide that information, I can't confirm it from the given text.\n\nWait, looking again, the document starts with Djokovic's title, but the date on that part isn't specified. The next part is about the 2023 women's final. Then, under the photo, it mentions July 15, 2023. Then, the article about Vondrousova is from 2023. Then, the next section starts with Jul 9, 2022, about Rybakina's win. So, the first part about Djokovic is from 2023. Therefore, the document doesn't mention the 2022 men's champion. So, based solely on the document, I can only confirm the women's 2022 champion as Elena Rybakina, but the men's 2022 champion isn't provided.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the initial part about Djokovic is from 2023, so the document doesn't cover the 2022 men's final. Therefore, I can't answer the men's part from the document. But I know from external knowledge that Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2022, but since the document doesn't provide that info, I can't include it. So, the answer would be that the women's champion in 2022 was Elena Rybakina, but the document doesn't provide the men's champion for that year. However, the question asks for both, so I might have to say that the information isn't sufficient.\n\nWait, but the initial part of the document says Djokovic defended his title, but that's in 2023, not 2022. So, the document doesn't have info on the 2022 men's champion. Therefore, I can only provide the women's champion for 2022, and the men's would be unknown based on the document. But the question asks for both. So, I should state that the information is insufficient.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The document starts by mentioning Djokovic's 21st title, defeating Kyrgios, but doesn't specify the year. The next part is about the 2023 women's final. Then, under the photos, it's about 2023 again. Then, the section starting Jul 9, 2022, talks about Rybakina's win. So, the initial part about Djokovic is likely from 2023. Therefore, the document doesn't mention the 2022 men's champion. So, I can only answer the women's part from 2022, and the men's part is not in the document.\n\nBut the user's question is about both 2022 champions. Since the document provides the women's 2022 champion but not the men's, I should say that the information is insufficient for the men's part. However, I also know from external knowledge that Djokovic won in 2022, but the document doesn't confirm that. So, I can't rely on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the document is mixing up years. Let me check again. The initial part says Djokovic defended his title, which was in 2023, as that's when he won his 21st. The 2022 men's champion was also Djokovic, but the document doesn't mention it. So, the document only provides the women's 2022 champion, not the men's.\n\nTherefore, I can only answer the women's part accurately from the document. For the men's, the document doesn't have the information, so I should say it's insufficient.\n\nBut wait, the document does mention Djokovic winning, but in 2023, not 2022. So, for 2022, the men's champion isn't provided. Therefore, the answer is that the women's champion was Elena Rybakina, but the men's champion isn't provided in the document. However, the user might expect both, so perhaps I should state that the information is insufficient for the men's part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can answer the women's part and note that the men's isn't available. But the user's question is about both, so I might need to state that the document doesn't provide the men's 2022 champion, but from external knowledge, it was Djokovic. However, since I'm supposed to rely only on the document, I can't use external knowledge. Therefore, I should say that the men's champion isn't provided, and thus, the information is insufficient.\n\nBut wait, the initial part of the document says Djokovic defended his title, which I think refers to 2023. So, in 2023, he won, but the document doesn't say who won in 2022. Therefore, for 2022, the women's champion is known, but the men's isn't. So, the answer would be that the women's champion in 2022 was Elena Rybakina, and the men's champion isn't provided in the document.\n\nBut the question asks for both. So, I should say that the women's champion is known, but the men's isn't, thus the information is insufficient for the men's part. Alternatively, perhaps I can only answer the women's part and leave the men's as unknown.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says that if the information isn't in the document, I should say that I can't answer because of insufficient information. So, since the document doesn't provide the men's 2022 champion, I can't answer that part. Therefore, the answer would be: The women's singles champion at Wimbledon 2022 was Elena Rybakina, but the document does not provide information about the men's singles champion, so I cannot answer that part.\n\nBut the question is a single question asking for both champions. So, perhaps I should state that the women's champion was Elena Rybakina, and the men's champion isn't provided in the document, so I can't answer that part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can only answer the women's part and say that the men's part is unknown. But the user's instruction says that if the document doesn't contain the answer, I should say I can't answer because of insufficient information. So, perhaps I should answer that the women's champion was Elena Rybakina, and for the men's, I can't answer due to insufficient info.\n\nBut the question is about both, so perhaps I need to structure the answer accordingly. Maybe I can say that Elena Rybakina was the women's champion, and the men's champion isn't provided in the document, so I can't answer that part.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says that if the information isn't in the document, I should generate \"I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.\" So, since the men's 2022 champion isn't in the document, I can't answer that part. However, the women's part is answerable. But the question is about both. So, perhaps I should answer the women's part and state that the men's part can't be answered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects both champions, so if one is missing, I should say that the information is insufficient. But I'm not sure. The instructions say that if the information in the document contains the correct answer, I should give it. If not, say I can't answer. So, for the women's part, I can answer, and for the men's, I can't. So, perhaps I should structure the answer as such.\n\nBut the question is phrased as a single question asking for both champions. So, perhaps I should say that the women's champion was Elena Rybakina, but the men's champion isn't provided in the document. Alternatively, I could say that I can't answer the question because the document doesn't provide the men's champion, but that would be incorrect because part of the question can be answered.\n\nI think the best approach is to provide the women's champion from the document and note that the men's champion isn't provided. But the user's instructions are a bit unclear on how to handle partial answers. Since the instructions say that if the document doesn't contain the answer, I should say I can't answer. But since part of the question can be answered, perhaps I should answer what I can and note the other part is missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should only answer the part that's in the document and ignore the other. But the question asks for both. So, perhaps I should state that the women's champion is known, and the men's isn't, thus the information is insufficient for the men's part.\n\nBut the user's instruction is that if the document doesn't contain the answer, I should say I can't answer. So, for the men's part, I can't answer. But the women's part I can. So, perhaps I should answer both, with the women's part from the document and the men's part as unknown.\n\nWait, but the user's question is asking for both champions, so perhaps I should provide both, but since the men's isn't in the document, I can't. Therefore, I should say that the information is insufficient to answer the question because the men's champion isn't provided.\n\nBut that's not accurate because the women's part is provided. So, perhaps I should structure the answer to include what's available and state that the men's part isn't available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial part of the document about Djokovic is referring to 2022. Let me check the date. The first part doesn't have a date, but the next section is from July 15, 2023. Then, the next section is from July 9, 2022. So, the initial part about Djokovic is from an unspecified date, but since the next part is 2023, perhaps the initial is 2023 as well. Therefore, Djokovic's win is in 2023, and the document doesn't mention the 2022 men's champion.\n\nSo, to sum up, based on the document, the women's singles champion at Wimbledon 2022 was Elena Rybakina. The men's singles champion isn't mentioned in the document, so I can't provide that information.\n\nBut the question asks for both. So, perhaps I should answer that the women's champion was Elena Rybakina, and the men's champion isn't provided in the document, so I can't answer that part.\n\nBut the user's instructions say that if the document doesn't contain the answer, I should say I can't answer.

So, perhaps I should provide what I can and note the other part is missing.\n\nI think the best approach is to provide the women's champion and state that the men's champion isn't provided in the document, thus the information is insufficient for that part. But the user's instruction is to say \"I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents\" if the information isn't present. So, since the men's champion isn't present, I should say I can't answer the question as a whole.\n\nBut that's not accurate because part of the question can be answered. So, perhaps I should answer the women's part and note the men's part is missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects both champions, so if one is missing, I should say I can't answer the whole question. But that seems less helpful.\n\nI think the most accurate approach is to answer the women's part and state that the men's part isn't available. Therefore, the answer would be: The women's singles champion at Wimbledon 2022 was Elena Rybakina. The document does not provide information about the men's singles champion for that year.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that if the information isn't in the document, I should generate the insufficient information response. So, perhaps I should structure it as such.\n\nWait, the initial part of the document mentions Djokovic's title, but without a date. So, perhaps that's referring to 2023. Therefore, the document doesn't have info on the 2022 men's champion. So, I can only answer the women's part.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the women's champion was Elena Rybakina, and the men's champion isn't provided in the document. But since the question asks for both, perhaps I should state that the information is insufficient.\n\nBut the user's instruction is that if the information in the document contains the correct answer, I should give it. If not, say I can't answer. So, for the women's part, I can answer, but for the men's, I can't. So, perhaps I should structure the answer to include both parts, with the women's from the document and the men's as unknown.\n\nBut the user's example response in the instructions shows that if the answer isn't in the document, the response should be \"I can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.\" So, perhaps if any part of the question isn't answerable from the document, I should respond with that.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because part of the question can be answered. So, perhaps I should answer what I can and note the other part is missing.\n\nI think the best approach is to provide the women's champion and state that the men's isn't provided, thus the information is insufficient for that part.

However, the document does not provide information about the men's singles champion for that year.\n\nBut since the question asks for both, I need to make sure I address both.

To adhere strictly, I should say that since the men's champion isn't in the document, I can't answer the question as a whole. But that's not helpful because part of it can be answered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can answer the women's part and then say that the men's part isn't available, thus the information is insufficient for the men's part.

Let me go through the document step by step.\n\nFirst, looking for Swiatek's titles. The document mentions that she won three major titles, but I think it's referring to her overall career. Wait, in 2022, she won the US Open, which is one major. Then it says she had a 37-match win streak and won eight titles in 2022. So that's eight titles for Swiatek in 2022.\n\nNow, checking Djokovic's titles. The document lists under the \"MEN WITH 2+ TITLES IN 2022\" section that Djokovic won five titles. It breaks them down as one major, ATP Finals, one 1000, one 500, and one 250. So that's five titles in total for Djokovic in 2022.\n\nSo, putting it together, Swiatek won eight titles and Djokovic won five titles in 2022.\n</think>\n\nSwiatek won 8 titles in the 2022 season, while Djokovic won 5 titles.\n\nAnswer: Swiatek won 8 titles and Djokovic won 5 titles in the 2022 season.", "docs": ["\"Obviously what happened 12 months ago was not easy for me, for my family, team, anybody who is close to me ...\" Djokovic said. \"You can't forget those events. It's one of these things that stays with you for, I guess, the rest of your life. It's something that I've never experienced before and hopefully never again. But it is a valuable life experience for me and something that as I said will stay there, but I have to move on.\" If Djokovic were to win, he would tie Nadal with 22 major titles, and be just one behind Serena Williams for the most in the Open era. As if there wasn't enough already on the line for him or anything. Prior to Carlos Alcaraz's withdrawal last week due to a right leg injury, it looked as if both of the reigning US Open champions would be looking for back-to-back major titles. But alas, that is not to be. But while Alcaraz won't be there, Swiatek certainly will be, and she will be attempting to cement her status as the heir apparent for tennis' superstar title. With Williams and Federer already retired, and Djokovic and Nadal nearing the ends of their careers, and in the absence of Alcaraz, all eyes will squarely be on her to step into those ever-so-large shoes.", "The 21-year-old has already won three major titles and firmly held onto the top ranking since Barty retired in April. As a two-time French Open champion, her dominance on clay has been evident for some time, but she proved she is just as dominant on the hard courts in 2022. During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic. Although she was handed a stunning 6-2, 6-2 loss by Jessica Pegula in the semis, the normally unflappable Swiatek will likely use that as motivation in Melbourne.", "It was the first women's Grand Slam title for this manufacturer.[128] Świątek's father also confirmed that she had also signed a contract with Rolex in 2021.

Let me start by looking at the documents provided.\n\nFirst, the document about Apple's financial results clearly states that in their fiscal Q3 2022, which corresponds to the second calendar quarter, Apple reported revenue of $83 billion. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, looking for Google's revenue in the same period. The document mentions that on October 25, 2022, Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported earnings below expectations, with a profit of $13.9 billion on revenue of $69.1 billion. However, I need to confirm if this revenue is for Q3 2022.\n\nWait, Alphabet's fiscal quarters might not align with the calendar quarters. Typically, companies report on a fiscal quarter basis, which might not match the calendar quarters exactly. But in the context of the question, it's asking for Q3 2022, which is the third quarter of the calendar year, typically July to September.\n\nLooking again, the Apple document specifies their fiscal Q3 as the second calendar quarter (April to June). So Apple's $83 billion is for their fiscal Q3, which is the second calendar quarter. But the question is about Q3 2022, which is the third calendar quarter (July to September).\n\nThe Google/Alphabet document mentions their earnings on October 25, 2022, which would correspond to their Q3 2022, aligning with the calendar third quarter. So their revenue of $69.1 billion is indeed for Q3 2022.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the exact quarters. Apple's fiscal Q3 is April-June, so their $83 billion is for that period. The question is about the third calendar quarter, so I need to make sure that Alphabet's $69.1 billion is for the same period.\n\nYes, the document says that on October 25, 2022, Alphabet reported Q3 earnings, which would be for the third calendar quarter. So the revenues are as stated.\n\nTherefore, Apple's revenue for their fiscal Q3 (which is the second calendar quarter) is $83 billion, and Alphabet (Google) reported $69.1 billion for their Q3 2022, which is the third calendar quarter.\n</think>\n\nThe revenues for Q3 2022 were as follows:\n\n- **Apple**: $83 billion (for their fiscal Q3, which corresponds to the second calendar quarter, April-June 2022).\n- **Google (Alphabet)**: $69.1 billion (for the third calendar quarter, July-September 2022).\n\nTherefore, Apple's revenue in Q3 2022 (fiscal) was $83 billion, and Google's (Alphabet) was $69.1 billion.", "docs": ["Apple today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter of 2022, which corresponds to the second calendar quarter of the year.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for.

But as both she and Jesse become more well known, she starts to find herself becoming trapped in a web of her own making. Susie Searches is a twisty, fun, and engaging film. Clemons brings relatability to a role that is, at its core, a non-heroic character. Susie's bubbliness and happy veneer put a fresh face on the type of character who wants fame so badly that they'll do anything to achieve it. Wolff brings his own brand of vulnerability to the film as Jesse, who's too pure for the world he inhabits. Other comedic actors, including Jim Gaffigan, Rachel Sennot, David Walton, and Ken Marino (who also shows off a more menacing side), also help make the film funny enough to lighten its heavy subject matter. Overall, Susie Searches is a funny and entertaining feature debut for writer-director Sophie Kargman. Families can talk about the tone of Susie Searches. Is it a comedy? A drama? A mystery? All of the above? Why is Susie obsessed with becoming famous? How does she think her podcast will help her do that? Why does she take certain actions in the film? How would you describe her ethics? How does the relationship between Susie and Jesse develop? How do Susie's expectations drive her actions?", "When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "Not enough data yet, please check again later.

All she cared about was spending time with Mom. So when Anne’s MS diagnosis advanced enough to take away her speech, Susie took over reading duties to keep the tradition alive. And she even took things one step further by choosing to make her mother’s wish come true: using her knack for literary detective work to do good in the world and become famous.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Stepping away from the brink of cancellation after two years of tumult, the rebooted Golden Globes ceremony  returns to the small screen Tuesday night.  The show was pushed out of the mainstream awards cycle last year after a Los Angeles Times investigation uncovered questionable self-dealing, ethical lapses and a lack of diversity among members of its parent organization, the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.   Awards  Winners of the 2023 Golden Globes include “House of the Dragon,” “Fabelmans,” “Abbott Elementary” and “The Banshees of Inisherin.”   The 80th Golden Globe Awards — which honors projects across film and television  and typically kicks off the awards season — will air at 5 p.m. Pacific Tuesday on NBC and will be streamed on the network’s premium Peacock service. The show will take place at its usual haunt, the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.  In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes’ return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show’s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?    NBC dropped the 2022 Globes broadcast  after a contingent of powerful publicists boycotted the organization and some studios — including Netflix and WarnerMedia — cut ties after The Times’ investigation.", "Due to conflicts with NBC's Sunday Night Football (the NFL regular season has been extended with an additional game since 2021), and to avoid competing with the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday January 9 (a game played at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium) and the 28th Critics' Choice Awards the following Sunday (January 15), the Globes ceremony was scheduled for Tuesday, January 10, 2023.[1] It was the first Golden Globes ceremony to take place on a Tuesday since the 19th edition in 1962, as well as the first to be staged on a weeknight since the 64th Golden Globes were presented on Monday, January 15, 2007.[24]  Among the changes include modifications to the supporting acting categories for television: Both categories for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film have been split into separate categories for \"Musical-Comedy or Drama\" and \"Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television\".[25][26][27]  The following films received multiple nominations:  The following films received multiple wins:  The following television series received multiple nominations:  The following series received multiple wins:  The Cecil B.

Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.", "\"We are thrilled to announce the return of the Golden Globe Awards on NBC and to hosting the 'Party of the Year' for audiences around the world who have been waiting for its return,\" HFPA president Helen Hoehne noted in a September 2022 statement, calling the awards a \"must-see\" event. \"The HFPA remains committed to important changes and supporting programs which prioritize diversity, inclusion, and transparency.

A day after his assassination shocked the world, police investigators are trying to learn the motives behind the killing of Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Although the shooter denied political motivations, he told police the attack had been planned for months. Abe was shot from behind in the western city of Nara while speaking at a campaign event ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections. Police arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, at the scene. Yamagami, an unemployed former sailor in Japan's maritime armed forces, confessed to the assassination in which he used a handmade firearm, according to police.   Police said Yamagami told them that he went to Okayama, another western city, where Abe was giving another campaign speech the day before the shooting, according to Kyodo News, which cited \"investigative sources.\" Yamagami denied any political motivations for the assassination, according to police.  Yamagami mentioned his mother's bankruptcy after she donated to an unnamed religious organization with which Abe had alleged ties, according to Japanese media reports.   Friday's shooting happened in a country where gun violence and political attacks rarely occur.", "96] Five vehicles carrying various old professional acquaintances of Abe's, including former defence minister Tomomi Inada, took part in the motorcade conveying Abe's body back to his home in Tokyo. At 1:35 pm, the party arrived at Abe's Tokyo residence. On their arrival, Sanae Takaichi, the chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council, Tatsuo Fukuda, the chairman of the LDP General Council[97] and Hisashi Hieda, the chairman of Fujisankei Communications Group and a friend of Abe's, received them. Afterwards, Kishida visited for condolences, and former prime ministers Yoshirō Mori and Junichiro Koizumi, Hiroyuki Hosoda (Speaker of the House of Representatives), Akiko Santō (President of the House of Councillors), Toshihiro Nikai (former Secretary-General of the LDP), Kōichi Hagiuda (Abe's close aide and the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry), Tetsuo Saito (a politician of Komeito and the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism), and Yuriko Koike (the Governor of Tokyo) also visited for condolences.[98]  Tetsuya Yamagami (山上 徹也, Yamagami Tetsuya), a resident of Nara, was arrested at the scene of the assassination.", "Abe was assassinated Friday on a street in western Japan by a gunman who opened fire on him from behind as he delivered a campaign speech - an attack that stunned the nation with some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere.

Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil.

I'll start by reading through the provided documents carefully to find the relevant information.\n\nIn the first document, it mentions that the ad-supported tier, called Standard with Ads, was launched in November 2022. It states that this tier costs $7 a month. Then, there's another mention of a Basic plan that's ad-free, which is priced at $15.49 a month. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because earlier it referred to the ad-supported tier as Basic with Ads but later changed the name to Standard with Ads. So, I need to clarify that.\n\nLooking further, the document says that Netflix's ad-supported plan is $7 a month, which is cheaper than Disney Plus and HBO Max's ad-supported tiers. It also notes that the ad-free Basic plan was removed, making the cheapest ad-free option the Standard plan at $15.49 a month.\n\nAnother part of the document mentions that the Basic with Ads tier is $6.99 a month, which is almost 55% lower than the Standard subscription. However, this seems conflicting because earlier it was stated that the ad-supported tier is $7 a month. I need to check if there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the $6.99 is an initial price, and then it was adjusted to $7. The document also states that Netflix currently offers three streaming plans: Standard with Ads at $7, Standard, and Premium, with the latter two being ad-free. The ad-free Basic plan is no longer available, so the cheapest ad-free is now $15.49.\n\nSo, to summarize: the Basic with Ads is $6.99, but later it's referred to as Standard with Ads at $7. The ad-free Basic was $9.99 but was removed, making the cheapest ad-free plan $15.49.\n\nWait, no, the document says that after removing the ad-free Basic plan, the cheapest ad-free is now $15.49. So the current ad-supported is $7, and the ad-free starts at $15.49.\n\nTherefore, the Basic with Ads is $6.99, but in the current plans, it's called Standard with Ads at $7. The ad-free Basic was $9.99 but is now gone, so the next tier is $15.49.\n\nI think the correct answer is that the Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the ad-free Basic was $9.99, but now the cheapest ad-free is $15.49. However, the current plans are Standard with Ads at $7, Standard at $15.49, and Premium at $20.\n\nWait, the document says: \"Netflix plans start at $7 a month, but to get the best video quality without ads you have to pay $20 a month.\" So the ad-supported is $7, and the ad-free Standard is $15.49, with Premium at $20.\n\nI think that's the accurate breakdown.

The document mentions that even though the House might flip, the Senate was still unclear but leaning towards remaining Democratic.\n\nPutting this together: After the 2022 midterms, the House was controlled by Republicans, as Kevin McCarthy became Speaker.

It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.

Let me start by looking at the documents provided.\n\nFirst, I see that the documents mention Group C, which includes Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Poland. The first match in this group was between Argentina and Saudi Arabia, which Saudi Arabia won, ending Argentina's 36-match unbeaten streak. So, Argentina is in Group C, and their first opponent was Saudi Arabia.\n\nNow, looking for Brazil's group. The documents provided don't explicitly mention Brazil's group. They talk about Group C in detail but also mention other groups like Group G where Cameroon played against Brazil. Wait, in one of the documents, there's a mention of Cameroon vs. Brazil in Group G. So, that must mean Brazil is in Group G. The document shows a match where Cameroon played Brazil at Lusail Stadium on December 2, 2022. However, that's the last group stage match, so I need to find Brazil's first opponent.\n\nSince the documents don't provide the first opponents for each group, I might need to infer. Typically, in the World Cup, each group plays their first matches against each other in a certain order. Group G consists of Brazil, Cameroon, Serbia, and Switzerland. The first matches for Group G would likely be Switzerland vs. Cameroon and Brazil vs. Serbia. But without explicit information, I can't be certain. However, in the documents, there's a mention of the match between Cameroon and Brazil, but that's the last group game. So, Brazil's first opponent would have been either Switzerland or Serbia, but the exact first opponent isn't specified in the provided documents.\n\nWait, looking back, the documents list the matches for Group C, but for other groups, only some matches are mentioned. The initial matches are listed as Qatar vs. Ecuador, Senegal vs. Netherlands, England vs. Iran, etc. For Group G, the first matches would be on November 24, 2022. The possible first opponents for Brazil in Group G would be Serbia, Switzerland, or Cameroon. Since the documents mention the Cameroon vs. Brazil match on December 2, which is the fifth matchday, I can infer that Brazil's first match was against Serbia on November 24, 2022.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Argentina is in Group C and their first opponent was Saudi Arabia. Brazil is in Group G, and their first opponent was Serbia.\n</think>\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup, Argentina was placed in Group C, where their first opponent was Saudi Arabia.

Let me look through the document provided.\n\nFirst, I'll search for the unemployment rate. I see a section mentioning that the unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percentage points to 5.1%. That seems clear. Another part talks about the U.S. unemployment rate being 3.7% in November 2022, but I think that might be a different context, maybe referring to a specific sector or another country. Wait, the document has two different mentions: one is 5.1% and another is 3.7%. I need to determine which is the overall rate.\n\nLooking closer, the 5.1% is mentioned in a section that seems to discuss general employment statistics, while the 3.7% is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since the question is about the general rates, I think the 3.7% is the correct overall unemployment rate for the U.S., and the 5.1% might be from another country or a specific group. Wait, no, the document starts with the CPIH and CPI, which are UK measures, so maybe the 5.1% is from the UK. The U.S. part mentions 3.7%, so I should note both if they are from different countries.\n\nNow, for the inflation rate, the document mentions CPI rose by 10.7% in the 12 months to November 2022. CPIH also had a rate, but I think CPI is the standard measure. So the inflation rate was 10.7%.\n\nWait, but in the document, it says the CPI rose by 10.7% in November 2022, down from 11.1% in October. So that's the annual rate. The monthly change was 0.4% for both CPIH and CPI.\n\nI think that's all the info I need. So the unemployment rate was 3.7% in the U.S. and 5.1% in another context, perhaps the UK.

Let me start by looking through the provided documents to see if I can find any relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the documents. The initial document mentions that the US men's team had to play Iran in their final group stage match. It says that a win would clinch a spot in the Round of 16, so the USA made it past the group stage. It also mentions that the match against Iran was on November 29, 2022.\n\nLooking further, there's a section about the Netherlands and USA match highlights from December 3, 2022, which suggests that the USA played the Netherlands in the Round of 16. That makes sense because the Round of 16 would take place after the group stages, so early December fits that timeline.\n\nNow, regarding Germany, I need to check when and who they played. Scanning through the documents, I see a list of matches with dates. On December 1, 2022, there's a mention of Japan playing Spain and Costa Rica playing Germany. The result shows that Japan won 2-1 against Spain, and Costa Rica lost 2-4 to Germany. Wait, that's a group stage match, not the Round of 16. I need to find Germany's opponent in the Round of 16.\n\nLooking through the documents again, I see that the group stage for Germany's group (which includes Japan, Spain, and Costa Rica) ended on December 1. The Round of 16 would be the next stage. However, the documents don't explicitly mention Germany's Round of 16 opponent. They do mention that on December 3, the USA played the Netherlands. But for Germany, the next match after the group stage would be in the Round of 16, likely on a different date.\n\nWait, the documents list a match on December 3, 2022, between the Netherlands and USA, which I already noted. Another part mentions that on December 1, Japan played Spain and Costa Rica played Germany. The results are Japan 2-1 Spain and Costa Rica 2-4 Germany. So, Germany won their last group match against Costa Rica. Now, looking at the group tables, Germany would have advanced as the second place in their group if Japan won against Spain. Since Japan beat Spain, Germany would have finished second in Group E.\n\nIn the Round of 16, the second place of Group E would face the winner of Group F. Looking at the group stages, Group F included teams like Morocco, Croatia, Belgium, and Canada. The documents show that Morocco beat Belgium and Canada, and drew with Croatia. So, Morocco won Group F, and Croatia was second. Therefore, the Round of 16 matchups would be:\n\n- Winner Group E (Spain or Japan) vs Runner-up Group F (Croatia)\n- Runner-up Group E (Germany) vs Winner Group F (Morocco)\n\nWait, no, the Round of 16 is structured so that the winner of Group E plays the runner-up of Group F, and the runner-up of Group E plays the winner of Group F. Since Morocco won Group F and Croatia was second, the matchups would be:\n\n- Winner Group E (Japan) vs Runner-up Group F (Croatia)\n- Runner-up Group E (Spain) vs Winner Group F (Morocco)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Group E had Japan, Spain, Germany, and Costa Rica. Japan won the group, Spain came second, Germany third, and Costa Rica fourth. So the runner-up of Group E is Spain, not Germany. Therefore, in the Round of 16, the second place of Group E (Spain) would play the winner of Group F (Morocco). The winner of Group E (Japan) would play the runner-up of Group F (Croatia). Therefore, Germany, being third in Group E, was eliminated and didn't make it to the Round of 16. Wait, that can't be right because the document mentions that Germany played Costa Rica on December 1 and won 4-2, which was their last group match. If they came third, they would be out, but the document doesn't mention their Round of 16 match.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the group standings again. In Group E, the matches were:\n\n- Japan vs Germany: Japan won 2-1\n- Spain vs Costa Rica: Spain won 7-0\n- Japan vs Costa Rica: Japan lost 1-0\n- Spain vs Germany: Spain and Germany drew 1-1\n- Japan vs Spain: Japan won 2-1\n- Costa Rica vs Germany: Germany won 4-2\n\nSo, the final standings would be:\n\n1. Japan: 6 points (wins against Germany and Spain)\n2. Spain: 4 points (win against Costa Rica and draw with Germany)\n3. Germany: 4 points (win against Costa Rica and loss to Japan, draw with Spain)\n4. Costa Rica: 3 points (win against Japan, loss to Spain and Germany)\n\nWait, but points-wise, Japan has 6, Spain has 4, Germany has 4, and Costa Rica has 3. But in case of equal points, the tiebreaker is goal difference. Spain's goal difference is +6 (7-0 vs Costa Rica, 1-1 vs Germany, 2-1 vs Japan) so total goals for: 7+1+2=10; against: 0+1+1=2. GD is 8. Germany's GD: 1 (from 2-1 loss to Japan) +1 (from 1-1 with Spain) +4 (from 4-2 vs Costa Rica). Total goals for:1+1+4=6; against:2+1+2=5. So GD is +1. Therefore, Spain is second, Germany third.\n\nTherefore, Germany was eliminated and did not make it to the Round of 16. Wait, but that can't be right because I know Germany usually advances, but maybe in this World Cup, they didn't. So, the Round of 16 matchups for Group E and F would be:\n\n- Japan (E1) vs Croatia (F2)\n- Spain (E2) vs Morocco (F1)\n\nTherefore, the USA played the Netherlands in the Round of 16, and Germany didn't make it, so they didn't play anyone in the Round of 16. But wait, I might be wrong because I'm relying on the documents which might not have all the info.\n\nWait, no, the documents mention that the USA played the Netherlands on December 3, which is the Round of 16. As for Germany, since they came third in their group, they didn't advance. Therefore, Germany didn't play in the Round of 16.\n\nBut I thought Germany was a strong team and usually advances, but according to the documents, they only got 4 points, same as Spain, but Spain had a better GD, so Spain went through as second. Therefore, Germany was eliminated in the group stage.\n\nSo, to answer the question: The USA played the Netherlands in the Round of 16, and Germany did not advance to the Round of 16, so they didn't play anyone there.\n\nWait, but in reality, I think Germany was eliminated in the group stage in the 2022 World Cup, so that aligns with this. Therefore, the answer is USA played Netherlands, and Germany didn't make it, so they didn't play anyone in the Round of 16.\n</think>\n\nThe USA played against the Netherlands in the Round of 16 at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Croatia failed in its bid to reach a second straight World Cup final after conceding two goals in a five-minute span from the 34th minute, just when the team was looking comfortable at Lusail Stadium. There was a moment midway through the first half that must have struck fear into all Argentines, when Messi appeared clutch his left hamstring and rub it.

It was uninspiring.” Speculation about Robbie’s casting as Barbie first began in 2015, after a Sony email leak reportedly revealed that she was among the actresses potentially being considered to play the famous doll. Years later, in October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Robbie was in talks to star in and produce the film with Warner Bros.  She also wasn’t the only star attached to the film.

It reinforces that the men's championship was on May 7th.\n\nNow, looking at the fifth document from May 6, 2023, it discusses the Women's Lacrosse Championship, celebrating their fourth straight title. It's dated May 6th and mentions the game recap, so I can conclude that the women's championship game was on May 6, 2023.\n\nPutting it all together, the men's championship was on May 7, 2023, and the women's was on May 6, 2023.

Let me go through the provided documents step by step.\n\nLooking at the documents, I see multiple entries from Dec 18, 2022, which probably pertain to the opening weekend. One document mentions that the film earned $134 million at the domestic box office during its opening weekend. That's the U.S. figure. Another part says it earned $77 million through its opening weekend, but that seems lower. Wait, maybe that $77 million is just from one night, like the opening night before the full weekend. So the $134 million is the total for the entire opening weekend in the U.S.\n\nNow, for the worldwide earnings. One document states that the global total was $435 million. But I should check if this is the opening weekend or the total up to a certain date. The document says \"so far earned $435 million at the global box office,\" but it's from Dec 18, 2022. Since that's the opening weekend, I think $435 million is the global opening weekend total.\n\nWait, another document from Jan 1, 2023, mentions that 69.4% of the global total came from overseas. But that's after the opening weekend, so maybe the $435 million is the opening weekend. Let me confirm: the Dec 18 document says it earned $134 million domestically and $435 million globally, which suggests that the global figure includes the U.S. opening. So the worldwide debut would be $435 million.\n\nI should also check for any inconsistencies. The $134 million domestic is consistent across the documents, and the global $435 million is mentioned once.

The document mentions that the Peach Bowl 2023 game is on December 30th, but it doesn't provide information about the 2022 game.

It describes a game where the Bulldogs attempted a field goal and Ohio State scored. The final score mentioned is Ohio State leading 38-24.

Moving from the well-appointed and brightly lit homes of small towns and the suburbs to the dark alleys of New York sounded like a desperate move (see “Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan”), but placing stalker sequences in crowds inspired some fresh thinking. There are a couple of truly frightening, patiently established suspense scenes, including one inside a subway car during Halloween that’s filled with people in costumes of horror villains, including multiple Ghostfaces. It’s a nicely staged vignette that, in keeping with the spirit of “Scream,” operates as a meta commentary on the glut of scary movies.

I remember reading the document, but let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking for Midjourney's founder. The document mentions David Holz in several places. He's referred to as the founder of Midjourney. For example, in the interview, he talks about the company and their approach, so that's a clear indication.\n\nNow, for Stability AI, the document talks about Mohammad Emad Mostaque. It states that he is the founder and CEO of Stability AI. There's a whole section dedicated to his background, including his education and other ventures before starting the company. So, that's the founder of Stability AI.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the document about these founders, so I can confidently answer based on that.\n</think>\n\nMidjourney was founded by David Holz, and Stability AI was founded by Mohammad Emad Mostaque.", "docs": ["He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that’s been surprising to me.", "As the technology goes mainstream, though, one company will be able to take some credit for its ascendancy: a 10-person research lab named Midjourney, which makes an eponymous AI image generator accessed through a Discord chat server. Although the name might be unfamiliar, you’ve probably seen the output from Midjourney’s system floating about your social media feeds already. To generate your own, you just join Midjourney’s Discord, type a prompt, and the system makes an image for you.  Midjourney exists on Discord because “people want to make things together” “A lot of people ask us, why don’t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?” Midjourney’s founder, David Holz, told The Verge in an interview. “But people want to make things together, and if you do that on iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that’s pretty hard. So if you want your own social experience, Discord is really great.” Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits, with all images generated in public chatrooms. After that, you’ll have to pay — either $10 or $30 a month, depending on the number of images you want to make and whether or not they’re private to you.  This week, though, Midjourney is expanding access to its model, allowing anyone to create their own Discord server with their own AI image generator.", "Mohammad Emad Mostaque  (Bengali: মোহম্মদ ইমাদ মোশতাক) is the founder and CEO of Stability AI, one of the companies behind Stable Diffusion.[2][4][5][6]  Mostaque was born on April 1983 to a Bengali Muslim family in Jordan. He was taken to Dhaka, Bangladesh a month after his birth, and migrated with his family to the United Kingdom at the age of seven.[3] He is a graduate of the University of Oxford.  At age 19, Mostaque met his wife while on a student trip to the United States. He has been diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD. In his twenties, he became interested in helping the Islamic world by creating online forums for Muslim communities and developing \"Islamic AI\" which would help guide people on their religious journey.[3]  After graduating, Mostaque went on to spend 13 years working at various hedge funds in the United Kingdom.[7][2]  In 2019 Mostaque founded Symmitree, a startup that aimed to reduce the cost of technology for individuals living in poverty, which he worked on for 1 year.[2]  In late 2020 Mostaque founded Stability AI.[2] Much of the company's funding comes directly from Mostaque, as well as other investment companies such as Eros Investments.", "“We’re going from a Midjourney universe to a Midjourney multiverse,” as Holz puts it. And he thinks the results will be incredible: an outpouring of AI-augmented creativity that’s still only the tip of the iceberg.  To find out more about Holz’s ambitions with Midjourney — about why he’s building an “engine for the imagination” and why he thinks AI is more like water than a tiger — we rang him up for an interview. And, of course, we got Midjourney to illustrate our conversation.  This interview below has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  It’d be great to start with a bit about yourself and Midjourney. What’s your background? How did you get in this scene? And what is Midjourney — a company, a community? How would you describe it? So, my name is David Holz, and I guess I’m a serial entrepreneur. My brief history would be: I had a design business in high school. I went to college for physics in maths. I was working on a PhD in fluid mechanics while working at NASA and Max Planck. I got overwhelmed at one point and put all those things aside. So I moved to San Francisco and started a technology company called Leap Motion around 2011.

Musk has said he will oversee product, technology and software and systems operations, while Yaccarino will focus on business operations. The announcement has left open the question of whether Musk will remain in charge of controversial policy decisions, many of which — including allowing users to buy blue verification checks and restoring the accounts of rule violators, including white supremacists — have threatened Twitter’s popularity with users and advertisers.            “Cleaning up Twitter requires reversing Musk’s dangerous policy decisions, reinvesting in content moderation and enforcement, and restructuring the platform’s governance,” Jessica Gonzalez, co-CEO of media watchdog Free Press who helped found the #StopToxicTwitter campaign encouraging advertisers to avoid the platform, said in a statement.            “Musk is setting future CEO Linda Yaccarino up to fail — as long as he continues to make the platform toxic, it will be impossible to lure back advertisers and users,” she said.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Let me start by looking through the provided documents to see if they mention anything about the developers or trainers behind these models.\n\nFirst, I see that the documents talk about LLaMA and Alpaca in the context of AI models. The first document mentions a trip to Capitol Reef and a llama hike, but that seems unrelated. The next parts discuss training llamas, which are the animals, but the question is about the AI models.\n\nLooking further, there's a section about the Stanford Alpaca model, which is described as an instruction-following LLaMA model. It mentions that the repository is for Stanford's Alpaca and that it's part of their research. So, Stanford University is likely involved in developing Alpaca.\n\nThen, there's information about Meta AI filing a DMCA takedown request related to LLaMA. This suggests that Meta (formerly Facebook) is the owner or developer of LLaMA. The document also mentions that Meta's LLaMA model was leaked, and there are projects like RedPajama to distribute an open-source version.\n\nAdditionally, the document talks about Hugging Face complying with takedown requests, indicating they might be hosting or involved in distributing these models, but they're not the creators.\n\nSo, putting it together, LLaMA is developed by Meta AI, which is part of Meta Platforms, Inc. Alpaca, on the other hand, is a project by Stanford University that builds upon LLaMA, possibly fine-tuning or adapting it for specific research purposes.\n\nI should make sure there's no conflicting information. The documents consistently mention Meta filing against LLaMA leaks, so that's a solid point. Stanford's Alpaca is clearly stated as their own project using LLaMA as a base. There's no mention of other developers, so I think this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe LLaMA model was developed by Meta AI, a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc. The Alpaca model, which is based on LLaMA, was developed by Stanford University as part of their research initiative.

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable?

Some speculated that the model would be used for malicious purposes, such as more sophisticated spam. Some have celebrated the model's accessibility, as well as the fact that smaller versions of the model can be run relatively cheaply, suggesting that this will promote the flourishing of additional research developments.[3] Multiple commentators, such as Simon Willison, compared LLaMA to Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image model which, unlike comparably sophisticated models which preceded it, was openly distributed, leading to a rapid proliferation of associated tools, techniques, and software.[3][18]  On April 17, 2023, Together launched a project named RedPajama to reproduce and distribute an open source version of the LLaMA dataset.[19] The dataset has approximately 1.2 trillion tokens and is publicly available for download.[20]", "Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience?  After we got home, I called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set.

It mentions several nominees: Michelle Yeoh for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" Cate Blanchett for \"Tár,\" Andrea Riseborough for \"To Leslie,\" Michelle Williams for \"The Fabelmans,\" and Ana de Armas for \"Blonde.\" The document states that Michelle Yeoh is expected to win and would be the first Asian woman to do so. There's also a part where it says, \"Will the statuette go to Cate Blanchett... or to Michelle Yeoh...\" which suggests a close race between them. Then, in another section, it explicitly mentions that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won the Original Screenplay award, but that's not directly about Best Actress. However, later on, it says, \"Michelle Yeoh ('Everything Everywhere All At Once') would become the first Asian woman to win in this category if she — as many expect — gets the Oscar.\" There's no mention of the actual winner in the document, so I can't confirm if she won or not.\n\nNext, for Best Supporting Actress, the document talks about Jamie Lee Curtis being a nominee. It mentions her causing a bit of a frenzy and being whisked away. There's another part where it says, \"Supporting actress nominee Jamie Lee Curtis has enjoyed getting to know her fellow nominees during this award season journey.\" However, the document doesn't explicitly state that she won. It does provide details about other categories, like \"Naatu Naatu\" winning Original Song and \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" winning Original Screenplay, but nothing definitive about the acting categories.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The document does mention that Jamie Lee Curtis was a supporting actress nominee and that she was at the event. But without a clear statement that she won, I can't be sure. The same goes for Best Actress—there's a lot of speculation but no concrete information on the winners.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided document, I can't find explicit information about who won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress.

The CFO departure at this point seems an outright setback, though.” Flavio Cereda, MD and analyst at financial services company Jeffries, writes: “No reasons have been disclosed for her decision to exit the group she joined six years ago, but it implies a further clean slate for new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd ahead of his strategic presentation (relaunch) in November.” “Julie has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth, supported by a high-quality team,” a statement from Akeroyd reads.

It just asks if it's worth the wait, so not helpful for the specific details.\n\nMoving to the second document on May 11, 2023. It talks about possible names like \"Google Pixel Notepad\" but also mentions the Pixel Fold as a suggested name before the official launch. So maybe the name is Pixel Fold, but I should check other documents to confirm.\n\nThe third document, also from May 11, clearly states that the Pixel Fold is the name, priced at $1799. It says Google became the latest to unveil it, but the release date isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe fourth document, June 27, 2023, provides more details.

This seems to confirm both the name and the release date.\n\nThe fifth document from April 18, 2023, mentions that Google will launch the Pixel Fold in June, but without the exact date.

{"id": 88, "query": "What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool and Microsoft's ai assistant in office?", "ans": ["Magic Editor", "Copilot"], "label": [0, 1], "prediction": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the names of Google's AI image editing tool and Microsoft's AI assistant in Office. Let me start by going through the provided documents to see if I can find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the document about Microsoft, it mentions something called \"Copilot.\" It says that Copilot is a chatbot integrated into Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. It also mentions that Copilot can help with tasks like creating SWOT analyses, PivotTables, transcribing meetings, summarizing emails, and more. So, it seems pretty clear that Microsoft's AI assistant in Office is called Copilot.\n\nNow, for Google's AI image editing tool. The document talks about Google's Imagen, which is a text-based image generation tool similar to Midjourney and DALL-E 2. However, it also introduces an advanced version called Imagen Editor. This tool allows users to edit specific parts of an image using text prompts and a masked region. It's described as being able to perform local edits, which is an improvement over the original Imagen. The document also mentions that Imagen Editor is currently in beta and might be released later, possibly through early access on Pixel phones.\n\nSo, putting it together, Google's AI image editing tool is called Imagen Editor, and Microsoft's AI assistant in Office is Copilot. I think that's the answer, but let me double-check the documents to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nYes, the document clearly states that Copilot is the name of Microsoft's AI assistant integrated into their Office suite. For Google, it's Imagen Editor, which is an advanced version of their existing Imagen tool, specifically designed for editing images with text prompts and masking. There's no other name mentioned for Google's image editing tool in the provided text, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nGoogle's AI image editing tool is called **Imagen Editor**, and Microsoft's AI assistant in Office is **Copilot**. \n\n**Answer:**  \nGoogle's AI image editing tool is named Imagen Editor, and Microsoft's AI assistant in Office is called Copilot.", "docs": ["As Copilot is essentially a chatbot, you can even ask it to create a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation based on a Word document or analyze or format Excel data.  That means Excel users can use Copilot to instantly create a SWOT analysis or a PivotTable based on data. In Microsoft Teams, the Copilot feature can transcribe meetings, remind you of things you might have missed if you joined late, or even summarize action items throughout a meeting. Spataro was quick to note that Copilot won’t always be correct, though. “Sometimes Copilot will get it right, other times it will be usefully wrong, giving you an idea that’s not perfect but still gives you a head start,” said Spataro during Microsoft’s AI event today. Copilot will also exist in Outlook, so you can spend less time deleting emails and responding. Email threads can be summarized, and Copilot can even create draft responses with toggles to adapt the tone or length of an email. “To build Copilot we didn’t just connect ChatGPT to Microsoft 365,” says Spataro. “Microsoft 365 Copilot is powered by what we call the Copilot system.” This system combines Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint with the Microsoft Graph of data and intelligence and GPT-4. Copilot uses grounding to improve the quality of the prompts its given.", "Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "You don't know me - #Film_is_real, i've never stopped it since 1984, but since 1996-2019, i did shot it less, in favor of more digital. Nowadays, i haven't had my 5D, my A7 into hands since years... Have a good weekend, and good light. Every such development takes us closer to some form of photo authenticity proofs. And possibly some regulation in this area. Maybe some obligatory and automatic tagging of edited images visible in web browsers, on social media etc.? Roger Dean the Father of AI. Google's Magic Editor looks quite promising. I can’t wait to try this! Knowing Google they will offer this via the worst UI and steal your pictures. But have fun 🤩 Vinyl has made a comeback. Now is the turn of film. Digital tech has had its pluses, but it is being abused without limits. Photography is about creativity and the moment. Using AI may help on noise or optimizing but for me it's far enough. Generate pictures with \"imagine child on a bank with balloons\" if there is nothing to capture, but it's not photography anymore. Is that photography? Or is it graphic design à la iPad brush drawing, just using bits of photo images? It's neither. It's a \"captured memory\". How it's captured is probably not so important to most people anyway. @Michael: it's not a memory if it's made up.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "And surely improvements will be made to its capabilities prior to a prime-time launch, which likely won't be until later this year or even 2024. Want to get your hands on the Magic Editor sooner rather than later? As of writing, it isn’t available to the public. But worry not, Google says it’ll 'give select Pixel phones early access to Magic Editor later this year.' Who exactly will get access and when, we can’t say. So be sure to keep an eye on Google’s blog for additional updates. I think a lot of the resentment directed at A.I. is because it makes tasks that used to take effort and skill almost effortless.  But that's technology.  The time and effort invested in learning a skill, tossed out the window.  In time, it won't even be necessary to learn to drive (a step many people skip, anyway).   But after automated focus, exposure and composition, what next?  A.I. lawyers suing other A.I. lawyers, A.I. doctors, A.I. CEOs and eventually, in the far distant future, the ability to accurately select brown hair in front of a brown wall. Good photography needs no manipulation.

Clark, 29, carded a closing round even-par 70 to finish 10-under overall and earn a $3.6 million winner’s cut of a record $20 million prize purse, the largest ever awarded in major history.

I remember that the user provided some documents that might help. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the documents, I see information about the Super Bowl MVP award in general. It mentions how the winner is chosen by a panel and fan votes. But that's more about the process, not specific MVPs.\n\nThen, I spot a section dated February 13, 2022. It talks about Cooper Kupp being named MVP of Super Bowl LVI. Wait, Super Bowl LVI is 56, right? Because Roman numerals can be tricky. LVI is 50+5+1, so 56. That would make it Super Bowl 56, which took place in 2022. So Cooper Kupp was the MVP for 2022.\n\nNext, there's a document from February 12, 2023, which mentions Patrick Mahomes winning the MVP award for Super Bowl 57. That's 2023 because Super Bowl 57 would be in 2023. So Patrick Mahomes is the MVP for 2023.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the Super Bowl numbers. LVI is indeed 56, and LVII is 55, wait no, actually, LVI is 50+5+1=56, and LVII would be 55+2=57. So Super Bowl 56 was in 2022, and Super Bowl 57 in 2023. So the MVPs are Cooper Kupp for 2022 and Patrick Mahomes for 2023.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the documents. Both MVPs are clearly stated in their respective sections. So I can confidently provide these names as the MVPs for those years.\n</think>\n\nThe MVPs for the specified Super Bowls are:\n\n- **Super Bowl 2022 (LVI):** Cooper Kupp\n- **Super Bowl 2023 (LVII):** Patrick Mahomes\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe MVPs of Super Bowl 2022 and 2023 were Cooper Kupp and Patrick Mahomes, respectively.", "docs": ["The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game.

To create chances for Kupp, McVay decided to go with some tempo, eschewing a huddle in hopes of slowing down the Bengals' pass rush and forcing them into more basic zone coverages. Kupp found soft spots in that zone, and Stafford found Kupp. On that final drive, Kupp had four catches for 39 yards, a 7-yard carry for a first down on fourth-and-1 and the winning score. According to Elias Sports Bureau research, Kupp is the second player with four-plus receptions on a go-ahead drive in the fourth quarter or later of a Super Bowl, joining Pittsburgh's Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII. That came despite the Bengals' best effort to keep Kupp from getting the ball. Before the final touchdown, Kupp drew three straight penalties -- a defensive holding, a defensive pass interference and an unnecessary roughness -- to set up the final score. \"Once we got down in the tight red area, it felt like it was about 60 plays for us to be able to finally get that one in on the fade,\" McVay said. \"And Cooper Kupp is the man.\" Kupp's Super Bowl heroics put the finishing touches on a stellar season in which he cemented himself as one of the league's best players.", "Making matters worse, the Rams could not run the football, totaling just 43 yards on the ground. But on the deciding drive, they moved the ball 79 yards on 15 plays for the winning score.  Kupp finished with three catches for 30 yards on the drive. He also ran for a critical first down on fourth-and-1 from L.A.’s 30-yard line, scampering 7 yards on an end-around to keep the chains moving. In addition, he coaxed two defensive penalties in the end zone to get Los Angeles closer to scoring position. \"That’s hard work, hours spent together,\" Stafford said when asked about the chemistry between him and Kupp. \"I just thank Coach for putting it in our hands: ‘Hey, Matthew, you and Coop go get this thing done.’ He kept calling plays for him, finding ways to get him the ball, and he made unbelievable plays. That’s what he does.\" Added Sean McVay: \"We were able to get them into some more regulated looks by playing fast. They still were tight-window throws. [Cincinnati] made it really difficult tonight.

However, there's no direct mention of FromSoftware here.\n\nThe second document discusses Sony's plans to expand PlayStation to mobile by 2025 and their acquisition of Savage Game Studios. It also mentions FromSoftware hiring for new projects, Elden Ring's success, and some comments about Bloodborne 2. But again, no information about who acquired a stake in FromSoftware.\n\nThe third document is about the Souls games and FromSoftware's success with Elden Ring. It talks about the studio's influence and design philosophy but doesn't mention any acquisition or investment.\n\nPutting it all together, none of the documents mention any company acquiring a stake in FromSoftware. The first document talks about a capital tie-up involving Tencent and others, but that's related to different companies, not FromSoftware. The other documents focus on FromSoftware's projects and success without indicating any acquisition.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, I can't determine who acquired a stake in FromSoftware because the necessary details aren't present in the documents.\n</think>\n\nI can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.", "docs": ["Tencent Holdings, anime planning and production company Twin Engine (production for Vinland Saga, Dororo, Pet), Mecha Comic digital service operator Amutus Corporation, and BookLive announced on Monday that they have entered into a capital tie-up.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer. But after “Elden Ring,” it’s now seen as a hitmaker."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0}

In 2021, Tesla was ranked as the most valuable automotive brand in the world. That same year, it was deemed the fastest growing brand on the planet. Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021. The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock. Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%.

According to Wall Street research firms, these three MATANA stocks have the best return potential over the next 12-plus months.

Given the challenging macro backdrop, others are more cautious. Rosenblatt Securities recently offered a $106 target which is less than 10% upside.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point.

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.", "A few days after that, he is set to unlock the doors on the New Delhi store, in a high-end mall in the Saket neighborhood. That store’s barricades lifted on Tuesday. The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. On Apple earnings calls, Cook has stressed India’s importance as a market and production base. During the latest such conference, Cook said Apple set “a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year” in the country. “India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,” Cook said on the call. “I’m very bullish on India.” --With assistance from Mark Gurman.", "Apple recently confirmed that the first Apple Retail Store in India would be opened later this month.

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India.
