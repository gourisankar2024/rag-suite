Gregory Clayton fair caught the football at the LSU 18 and the penalty moved the ball to the 33. Nussmeier entered at quarterback on LSU’s third offensive possession of the game.

Daniels returned at quarterback for the Tigers, finding Nabers for a 17-yard connection to the Purdue 46 and then finding Taylor for a 32-yard touchdown completion, creating some separation with an early 21-0 advantage with 13:03 to play in the second quarter.  On their next offensive possession, Daniels went back to Taylor for a 15-yard completion over the middle of the field to the LSU 45.

The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score.

The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone.

It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls.

For most photos, every four pixels are combined into one large quad pixel for even better low-light performance. The 48-megapixel lens also enables a 2x Telephoto mode that uses the middle 12 megapixels for full-resolution photos with no digital zoom. This joins the existing 3x zoom enabled by the dedicated Telephoto lens, which has also been improved.   The iPhone 14 Pro models are able to shoot at the full 48MP with ProRAW, enabling the new iPhones to take impressive professional photos. Second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization reduces shake and blur, and a new 12 megapixel Ultra Wide camera has larger pixels for sharper images with more details and a better macro mode. The TrueDepth front-facing camera has an improved f/1.9 aperture for better low-light selfies and videos, and it supports autofocus for the first time.

The conference typically features keynote speeches, technical sessions, and product announcements, and attracts both developers and consumers. Google announced Google I/O 2023 through a blog post on the official Google Developers website in March. The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels. Like previous years, Google also teased the event with a binary field puzzle that fans had to solve to reveal the launch date. Googgle I/O 20213 took place on 10 May.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers. We are grateful for the opportunity. - Sundar  Editor’s note: Below is an edited transcript of Sundar Pichai's keynote address during the opening of today's Google I/O Developers Conference.

While the yearly event is primarily targeted at developers, there will be plenty of fun stuff for enthusiasts and the general public. Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However, the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools.

Her focus on bread-and-butter issues also resonated with voters. Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points. The difference may be partly explained by late-deciding voters. Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.", "5%, a narrower margin than in the 2017 election.

College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast, but it’s not getting the traction she’s hoping for.

When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat.

This post originally appeared on Chicago Booth’s Initiative on Global Markets. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke of the Brookings Institution, Douglas Diamond at Chicago and Philip Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis “for their research on banks and financial crises”. Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal for developing a way of “snapping molecules together” that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs to target cancer and other diseases.

This might not be as bad as it sounds, mind you. The 12GB edition was supposed to start at $899, although its dependence on third-party manufacturers was likely to raise real-world pricing higher. The muddled messaging largely stems from differences beyond RAM quantities.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) — Rishi Sunak became Britain’s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country’s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His removal would have set off new tremors."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'

Freddy Freeman is Billy's physically disabled foster brother and also the first person to learn that Billy has superpowers. Freddy is an expert on all things superheroes and helps Billy learn more about his powers. Freddy Freeman's adult form, formerly known as Captain Marvel Jr. in the comics, wears a blue super suit and has a great deal of flight power, which is fitting because that was the superpower he told Billy he wished he could have.

And he thinks the results will be incredible: an outpouring of AI-augmented creativity that’s still only the tip of the iceberg.  To find out more about Holz’s ambitions with Midjourney — about why he’s building an “engine for the imagination” and why he thinks AI is more like water than a tiger — we rang him up for an interview. And, of course, we got Midjourney to illustrate our conversation.  This interview below has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  It’d be great to start with a bit about yourself and Midjourney. What’s your background? How did you get in this scene? And what is Midjourney — a company, a community? How would you describe it? So, my name is David Holz, and I guess I’m a serial entrepreneur. My brief history would be: I had a design business in high school. I went to college for physics in maths. I was working on a PhD in fluid mechanics while working at NASA and Max Planck. I got overwhelmed at one point and put all those things aside. So I moved to San Francisco and started a technology company called Leap Motion around 2011. And we sold these hardware devices that would do motion capture on your hands, kind of inventing a lot of the gestural interface space.", "He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.  “It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better.

But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel’s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that’s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar’s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin. Elsewhere, we see it barreling into obstacles to open up new parts of the world. That aspect is a major departure for the series and should make it stand apart from previous entries.

This installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren’t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles.

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?", "Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience?  After we got home, I called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way.

Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas.

A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail.

That’s when the power officially shifts from the four coaches (Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan) to the viewers at home. Prior to that, the coaches helped narrow down their teams in the blind auditions, battles, knockouts and playoffs. Of the remaining artists, who do YOU think will ultimately join the winners list for this Spring 2023 cycle on NBC? Each week, America will vote for their favorite contestants, with the highest vote-getters advancing to the next round. The singers who receive the lowest number of votes will be eliminated from the competition.

Following the performance, Miles had her pick between Horan and Kelly Clarkson. Horan noted that he could sense Miles was nervous, but that he could also tell she has a lot of character in her voice — something he said was particularly impressive considering Miles is just 18. “You’re gonna grow into this competition,” he told the singer from Illinois. “I feel like you’ve got so much more to give. This is very exciting. Well done.” Although Clarkson said she was “a really big fan” of Miles’ voice and could help the singer improve her vocal techniques, Miles ultimately opted to join Horan’s team, where she stayed for the entire competition. Her performances on the show included Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used to Know,” Kodaline’s “All I Want” and Chris Isaak’s “Wicked Game” — which caught the attention of Isaak himself.  “Wow! Consider my chair turned, Gina Miles!” Isaak shared on Facebook. “Great job.", "On Monday night, ahead of the finale, Miles told PEOPLE she wanted to make the best of her experience during the last show.   “I’m going to live it up no matter what happens because to me it’s not about winning it’s just about the experience as it’s come along,” she said at the time. “For me, I never thought I would make it this far but I did.”   She added. “I want to be living my best life.”   To celebrate Blake Shelton's final season, several familiar faces returned to the show, including Camila Cabello, Jennifer Hudson, Nick Jonas, John Legend and Adam Levine, who all previously coached alongside Shelton on The Voice.

In addition, Bryce Leatherwood from Team Blake became the second Wild card Instant Save winner to make it to the finale, after Hailey Mia in season 21.

This is my favorite fact now.  Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he’s started the process of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait.  He’s also dealt with some crises: he’s fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money. Then, an attempt to change the open gaming license for Dungeons & Dragons led to fan backlash, and Hasbro walked the entire plan back.", "Nyman will oversee global business, operational and foundational platform investments; continue to lead Hasbro’s overall consumer licensing strategy and strategic partnerships; and oversee Hasbro’s global supply chain, directing the strategy for a next-generation consumer direct distribution platform.

The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested.

Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos). This time last year, we saw the arrival of Magic Eraser, which lets you remove unwanted people or objects from your photos with a flick of your finger.", "Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "And for a finishing touch, relocate and change the scale of your subject so they’re perfectly lined up under the waterfall. Using Magic Editor, you’ll also be able to create new content to fill in the gaps after repositioning your subject. Take this picture of a boy on his birthday. It’s a good photo but it could be better if he was front and center. With the power of generative AI, you can create more of the bench and balloons to fill in those gaps, and they’ll blend seamlessly into your photo. The end result? A stunning shot that captures the feeling of his big day. We plan to give select Pixel phones early access to Magic Editor later this year. While this new, experimental technology will open up exciting editing possibilities, we know there might be times when the result isn’t exactly what you imagined. Your feedback will be important in helping us improve it over time so you can get the best edits possible. Over the past few years, AI has simplified complex photo editing tasks, allowing you to easily enhance your memories and get creative with your editing. And with these tools, you all collectively edit 1.7 billion photos each month — right in Google Photos. Magic Editor will take the editing experience to the next level, and we can't wait to see how you turn your photos into something even more stunning and special to you.

Sponsored by the streaming service YouTube TV, the series was officially known as the 2022 NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV.[6] This edition of the Finals was a rematch of the 1964 NBA Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the then-San Francisco Warriors in five games.[7]  During the 2021 offseason, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens president of basketball operations, replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[8] Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, a 2021 first-round pick, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for Al Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick.[9] Needing a replacement for Stevens, Brooklyn Nets assistant coach Ime Udoka was hired as the new head coach. After starting the season 16–19 and in 10th place in the Eastern Conference standings, the Celtics finished the regular season with a record of 51–31, winning 35 of their final 47 games to finish with the second-best record in the conference.[10]", "The 2022 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2021–22 season.

Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed.

Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.  On March 9, 2022, the Phoenix Suns became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[13]  On April 5, the San Antonio Spurs and New Orleans Pelicans became the last two teams to qualify for postseason play, as both teams secured spots in the first-stage play-in tournament. On April 7, the Denver Nuggets became the final team to secure a direct berth in the playoff bracket, qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and relegating the Minnesota Timberwolves to the play-in tournament.[14] While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[15]  Seeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 12–15.", "This was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, and the second since the New Jersey Nets relocated to Brooklyn in 2012, with the Nets winning the first three meetings.[44]   Despite finishing the game with 21 turnovers and blowing a 16-point lead, the Bucks outlasted the Bulls 93–86.

While the Bulls were leading by as much as 18 in the third quarter, they withstood two furious rallies in both the third and fourth quarters by the Bucks, with DeMar DeRozan scoring a playoff career-high 41 points.

FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating.

It’s important to note that within the first six months of 2023, Nvidia’s shares have experienced a bullish rally that has surprised many, as nobody expected the chip designer to achieve such success in its AI venture, resulting in a modest gain of 187% as of July 2023. Therefore, although Alphabet is considered the best investment option within the MATANA group, it would be wise to pay attention to Nvidia and keep track of its investments before becoming infatuated with a single stock. Who knows if their entry into AI might end up generating better returns than those offered by Alphabet? Ray Wang, Founder, Chairman and Principal Analyst of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc, said the MATANA group should be considered the new name for Big Tech stocks instead of FAANG. Wang believes that MATANA companies significantly outperform FAANG by excluding Meta and Netflix and including tech giants Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia. According to Wang, Meta needs a better growth plan beyond advertisements and its foray into the metaverse, while Netflix raises doubts about its growth potential in terms of adding more subscribers. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted that Microsoft is one of the technology companies best positioned to excel in the metaverse, cloud computing, and the gaming industry, which generates trillions of dollars annually.", "This has ushered in a new collection of ‘must-have’ tech innovators that dominate their respective markets. Yet with these names commanding $100 to $200 share prices, owing all six may be impractical (until a MATANA exchange-traded fund (ETF) invariably comes along). So how is one to choose among the cream of the crop?  Hakuna Matata, no worries. According to Wall Street research firms, these three MATANA stocks have the best return potential over the next 12-plus months. With an average analyst price target of $137, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most room to run. At current levels, this equates to more than 40% upside. Some sell-side firms see the e-commerce leader going much higher.  Earlier this month, Tigress Financial gave Amazon a $192 target, which suggests the stock can double from here. Given the challenging macro backdrop, others are more cautious. Rosenblatt Securities recently offered a $106 target which is less than 10% upside. Whether Amazon soars or merely inches higher from here will depend on two questions: 1) will inflation and rates cool enough to spur a significant revival in online shopping activity, and 2) will an improved economic outlook push more enterprises to spend on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure?", "And that is the fundamental problem with its one-trick-pony business model. Growth could be limited if it is uniquely tied to its subscription model. Said Wang: “Product placement should be where they are, plus the ability to do (intellectual property) licensing. Look at how Disney makes its money.” Netflix Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT): According to Wang, the company has found a way to straddle key segments – what it provides corporate and consumer clients. Wang’s take: “They’re positioned well for the metaverse. They’re positioned well for the cloud and, of course, they’ve got their gaming business.” Microsoft Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA): Its growth potential lies with the continuously expanding need for microchips, but also in how it can play a big role in the emerging fields that could very well define the future. Said Wang: “Nvidia is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and more than the data center or gaming. They’re sitting at the edge between (artificial intelligence), the metaverse, the future of computing and the way they do their partnerships. They’re set up in a way that’s going to be dominant for quite some time.” Nvidia Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): The promotion into the acronym could settle a long-standing debate, confirmation that Tesla is not just a car company.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India.

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.
