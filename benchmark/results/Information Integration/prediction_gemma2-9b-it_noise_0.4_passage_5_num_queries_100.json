The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl. Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle.

The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science,” the academy said. The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation.

Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However, the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers. We are grateful for the opportunity. - Sundar  Editor’s note: Below is an edited transcript of Sundar Pichai's keynote address during the opening of today's Google I/O Developers Conference.

Iga Świątek has won the 2023 women’s French Open final over Karolina Muchová. This marks her second consecutive French Open championship and the third overall of her career. We often call Rafael Nadal the “king of clay,” and it seems Świątek may already be carving out “the queen of clay” moniker for herself. This is the fourth career major win for the world’s #1 women’s tennis player.  Świątek was the favorite heading into the tournament with -125 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. Her odds only increased as she made her way through the tournament field. She went into the finals as the -900 moneyline favorite over Muchová.  Świątek started off serving, won her first game, and then broke Muchová for an early 2-0 set lead. She held strong her second service, but Muchová picked up her first game win, serving for the second time to move it to 3-1. Game 5 saw four deuces played, but Świątek picked up the eventual win to move it to 4-1. Muchová responded with a win of her own that saw two deuce frames, already calling into question the endurance of the two competitors after a long tournament.", "Advertisement Supported by Swiatek was drawn into a tight match with Karolina Muchova, and emerged with her third singles championship at Roland Garros in four years.

Muchova, whose smooth and athletic game has been one of the sport’s best kept secrets for years, struggled with errors early but found her form and gave Swiatek the final of her life, forcing her to use every bit of the clinical, relentless approach that had made her the world’s top player — and then some — for more than a year. Swiatek outlasted Muchova, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 in a breathtaking, up-and-down battle that met the moment of one of the grandest stages in the sport.

During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove.

Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for.

The fallout from his accusations led Columbia to acknowledge that it had provided misleading data, and the school did not submit new data last year. Tuesday’s announcement makes that decision permanent. In making the announcement, Columbia applauded the recent move by U.S. News to focus on the success of colleges in graduating students from different backgrounds. But Columbia also suggested that it was concerned about the inclusion of data from students in its general studies program, who tend to follow nontraditional academic paths. Colorado College also withdrew from the rankings this year, along with Bard College, Rhode Island School of Design and Stillman College, a historically Black school in Alabama. L.

This follows a rise of 4.0% in the previous period. The next update on inflation is scheduled for release on Aug. 10 at 8:30 a.m. ET. It will provide information on the rate of inflation for the 12 months ended July 2023. Below is a chart and table displaying annual US inflation rates for calendar years from 2000 and 2013 to 2023.

If you would like to calculate the accumulated rates between two different dates, you can use the US Inflation Calculator.  *The latest inflation data (12-month based) is always displayed in the chart’s final column. Table: Annual Inflation Rates To find annual inflation rates for a calendar year, look to the December column. For instance, the inflation rate in 2022 was 6.5%. Meanwhile, the \"Ave\" column shows the average inflation rate for each year using CPI data. In 2022, the average inflation rate was 8.0%.

The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.  Stock investors in the United States remain worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report.

They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA.

Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday?

This column addresses criticisms that Diamond and Dybvig did nothing but mathematically formalise something everyone already knew, or should have known, and that Bernanke was rewarded less for his research than for his later role as a policymaker.    The 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences went to Ben Bernanke, a household name, and Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, who were largely unknown to the public but immensely influential within the profession. Few economists predicted the 2008 financial crisis, but when it happened, few found it baffling; in the days after the fall of Lehman, economists could in effect be found roaming the halls of their departments, muttering “Diamond-Dybvig, Diamond-Dybvig.” This year’s prize was, in a way, unusual. Nobel prizes in the hard sciences are generally given for one important piece of research; economics Nobels are typically more like lifetime achievement awards. This time, however, the award largely honoured one seminal paper, Diamond and Dybvig’s 1983 “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,” together with Bernanke’s paper of the same year, “Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression.", "Andrew Limbong                        Erneaux, photographed in 1984, is known for her works that deal with shame, sexism and class.

Shahi will be seen as Adrianna Tomaz, aka Isis, in the widely anticipated DC film Black Adam. One of the film's most fascinating aspects is Black Adam's relationship with Adrianna Tomaz. Regarding her role in the film, Sarah Shahi said during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Adrianna Tomaz has a brother named Karim, played by actor Mohammed Amer. Not many other plot details are known at this point, but it'll be interesting to see how Adrianna Tomaz's role as Black Adam's love interest pans out in the film. Black Adam chronicles the eventful story of the titular character who returns to the modern world after centuries of imprisonment and teams up with the Justice Society of America (JSA).

Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters.

Since its introduction on October 12, 2022, the Nvidia RTX 4090 has been going off the shelf rapidly. While retailers have finally managed to get plenty of these powerful GPUs on their shelves, the Founders Edition is always snatched up like hotcakes. As the speediest GPU in the 40-series, the RTX 4090 is far beyond the capabilities of every other commercially available gaming GPU.

Looking back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) — Rishi Sunak became Britain’s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country’s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil. His removal would have set off new tremors.", "Rishi Sunak (/ˈrɪʃi ˈsuːnæk/ (listen) RISH-ee SOO-nak;[1][2] born 12 May 1980) is a British politician who has served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since 2022. He is the first British Asian prime minister. He previously held two cabinet positions under Boris Johnson, lastly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022. Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) since 2015.  Sunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.  Sunak was elected to the House of Commons for Richmond in North Yorkshire at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum.", "We use some essential cookies to make this website work.

Sports scientists and mathematicians have spent years studying the best and fairest ways to organise tournaments. With five billion people expected to tune in to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the pressure to get it right is on. The most frequent criticism of FIFA’s draws for World Cup groups is that they tend to produce groups of unequal strength. Some may get a comparatively easy ride through the group stage while others could find themselves in a “group of death”. Organisers need to make sure strong teams aren’t penalised for their strength, while avoiding the emergence of any weak groups, to maintain fairness and keep TV audiences riveted.  FIFA’s seeding system assigns the host nation and the seven strongest teams to each of the eight groups. To guarantee a geographical spread, it defines six qualifying zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Central America, with the Caribbean, Oceania and South America in the final pot. No two teams from the same zone – except Europe – can be in the same group, while no more than two European teams can be in the same group. At first glance, this year’s draw seems pretty even-handed.

I think ultimately it is a conversation we’re having about ourselves, but it’s easy to put it on Barbie.” Robbie along with her Ken, Ryan Gosling, and I were speaking in Beverly Hills a few weeks before the film opens on July 21, a date that has turned into a gender battle at the box office between “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical drama about the making of the atomic bomb, “Oppenheimer.” That hasn’t stopped Robbie and Gosling from vibrating with excitement over what they’ve created and the deep understanding their writer-director Greta Gerwig had for the material. (Gerwig co-wrote the script with her partner, Noah Baumbach.) Gosling compared her work to Warhol’s Campbell’s soup can: “It’s like showing you this thing that you’ve seen a million times as art,” he said. “Once I read the script, I felt like I was seeing all these things that were around me in a completely new and deep and hilarious way.” Gerwig in an email likened her stars to “top-flight race cars just hanging out and sometimes racing, but just for fun,” and added “I think they were both just delighted by the other.” In our conversation Robbie and Gosling spoke about Friday-night script readings with Mattel executives, how Ken is regarded in the Gosling household and leaning in to the thorny aspects of Barbie.

Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'  She also spoke about her feeling towards playing Barbie in the film, saying: 'It's great to do comedy.

It was uninspiring.” Speculation about Robbie’s casting as Barbie first began in 2015, after a Sony email leak reportedly revealed that she was among the actresses potentially being considered to play the famous doll. Years later, in October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Robbie was in talks to star in and produce the film with Warner Bros.  She also wasn’t the only star attached to the film. In 2016, Amy Schumer had reportedly landed the role but dropped out a few months later due to scheduling conflicts, according to THR. In 2017, Anne Hathaway was  reported to possibly star.  Greta Gerwig has been attached to the Barbie flick since 2019, when she was confirmed to write the script with Noah Baumbach.

A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman!

Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI. The presentation included how they were exploring whether LaMDA could generate videos, realistic speech, and even write fiction.                    Is this the future of comedy?

We’ve been working on an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA, that we’re calling Bard. And today, we’re taking another step forward by opening it up to trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks. Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping you to explain new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right now, and then get drills to build your skills. Use Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old. We’re releasing it initially with our lightweight model version of LaMDA. This much smaller model requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback.

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?", "Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience?  After we got home, I called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way.

Samsung recently brought attention to the power of AI-“enhanced” photos with “Space Zoom,” a feature that’s supposed to let you capture incredible pictures of the Moon on newer Galaxy devices. In March, a Reddit user tried using Space Zoom on an almost unsalvageable image of the Moon and found that Samsung appeared to add craters and other patches that weren’t actually there. Not only does this run the risk of creating a “fake” image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras. As my colleague Allison Johnson points out, mobile photography already fakes a lot of things, whether it’s by applying filters or unblurring a photo, and doctored images are nothing new. But Google’s Magic Editor could make a more substantial form of fakery easier and more attractive.", "Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "May 12, 2023 ... Google teased its new AI-enhanced editing tool at this year's I/O conference.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far.

Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options.

Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point.
