Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter.

Hmm, that's conflicting. Let me check the dates to make sure I'm looking at the right year. The document mentions the 79th Golden Globes, which would typically correspond to the year 2021 or 2022, but \"The Power of the Dog\" was indeed a big film around that time.

As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle.

Sharpless previously shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry, first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’” says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.", "The Nobel committee said in a statement that “click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions have taken chemistry into the era of functionalism,” adding that “this is bringing the greatest benefit to humankind.” Among her many awards, Bertozzi is a recipient of the 2014 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy’s highest scientific honor. She was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1999. She won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 2022. Bertozzi completed her undergraduate degree in chemistry at Harvard University and her Ph.D. at UC Berkeley.

Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

Novak Djokovic is not only bidding for a third crown at Roland Garros, but also to lift a 23rd Grand Slam singles trophy to break his tie with Nadal for the most in men’s history. He can also become the first man to win all four majors at least three times and, at 36, the oldest French Open men’s or women’s singles champion.

Ruud started strong, winning the first three games before Djokovic won his first. The opening losses weren't new for the Serbian star. It’s not the rope-a-dope, exactly, but he has lost the first set of major matches before and has almost always come storming back to even the score and crush his opponent. On Sunday he came back in the first set itself, tying Ruud 4-4 before forcing a tiebreak. That’s when Djokovic Prime activated.

Muchova, whose smooth and athletic game has been one of the sport’s best kept secrets for years, struggled with errors early but found her form and gave Swiatek the final of her life, forcing her to use every bit of the clinical, relentless approach that had made her the world’s top player — and then some — for more than a year. Swiatek outlasted Muchova, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 in a breathtaking, up-and-down battle that met the moment of one of the grandest stages in the sport.

Let me start by going through the provided documents to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the women's singles. There's a section that mentions the final between Iga Świątek and Karolína Muchová. It says that Świątek defeated Muchová in the final with the score 6–2, 5–7, 6–4. So, that clearly indicates that Muchová was the runner-up in the women's singles.\n\nNow, for the men's singles, the documents talk about the final between Novak Djokovic and Casper Ruud. It mentions that Djokovic was trying to win a record 23rd Grand Slam title and that Ruud was in his second consecutive French Open final. The outcome isn't directly stated in the provided text, but I know from general knowledge that Djokovic won the 2023 French Open, so Ruud must have been the runner-up.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the documents actually confirm the men's final result. Let me check again. The document discusses the potential for Djokovic to make history and mentions that Ruud is chasing his first Slam title, having lost in the US Open final the previous year. It also talks about Djokovic's path to the final and his previous meetings with Ruud. However, the document doesn't explicitly state the result of the 2023 men's final. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. The document only sets up the final and the possibilities but doesn't provide the actual outcome. So, based solely on the provided documents, I can't confirm who the men's runner-up was because the result isn't mentioned. However, from external knowledge, I know that Djokovic won, making Ruud the runner-up, but since the document doesn't specify, I might have to rely on that external knowledge.\n\nWait, but the user instructed to use only the provided documents. So, if the documents don't have the men's final result, I can't answer that part. But the women's runner-up is clearly stated as Muchová.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the document does mention the women's final result but not the men's. So, I can only answer the women's part accurately. For the men's, since the document doesn't provide the result, I can't confirm it. But wait, the document does mention that Djokovic was in the final against Ruud, but it doesn't say who won. So, I can't determine the men's runner-up from the documents alone.\n\nWait, but in the initial part of the document, it says that Djokovic is trying to win the final, so it's implied that he did win, making Ruud the runner-up. But the document doesn't explicitly state the outcome, so I can't be certain. Therefore, based on the provided documents, I can only confirm the women's runner-up, but not the men's.\n\nWait, no, the document does mention that Djokovic won because it says he's trying to win a record 23rd Grand Slam title, and the context implies that he did win. So, perhaps the document does have the information. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the document says: \"History will be on the line for Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros on Sunday as he tries to win a men's record 23rd Grand Slam title.\" It also mentions that he's facing Casper Ruud in the final. But it doesn't explicitly state that he won. So, without that information, I can't confirm the runner-up.\n\nWait, but in the women's section, it clearly states that Świątek won, so Muchová is the runner-up. For the men's, since the document doesn't provide the result, I can't answer that part. Therefore, I can only provide the women's runner-up, but not the men's.\n\nWait, but the user's question asks for both men's and women's runners-up. Since the document doesn't have the men's result, I can't answer that part. So, I should respond that I can't answer the men's part due to insufficient information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the document does mention the men's result elsewhere. Let me check again. The document starts by talking about the women's achievements, then moves to the men's final setup, but doesn't provide the outcome. So, no, the men's result isn't in the document.\n\nTherefore, I can only answer the women's runner-up, which is Karolína Muchová, and state that there's insufficient information for the men's.\n</think>\n\nThe runner-up in the women's singles at the 2023 French Open was Karolína Muchová. However, there is insufficient information in the provided documents to determine the runner-up in the men's singles.\n\nAnswer: The runner-up in the women's singles was Karolína Muchová.

Let me start by looking through the document provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look for information about Iga Swiatek. The document mentions that in 2022, she had a prolific season where she added two more major titles, bringing her total to three. It also says she won eight titles in 2022, which includes two majors. Additionally, she had a 37-match winning streak and won three 1000-level hard court titles in Qatar, Indian Wells, and Miami. So, for Swiatek, it seems she won eight titles in 2022.\n\nNow, looking for Djokovic's information. The document talks about Djokovic in the context of the 2023 season, mentioning that if he were to win, he would tie Nadal with 22 major titles. However, the document doesn't provide specific numbers about how many titles Djokovic won in 2022. It only mentions that he's nearing the end of his career and his past experiences, but no exact count of titles for that year.\n\nSince the document doesn't have details on Djokovic's 2022 titles, I can't provide a number for him. Therefore, I can only state how many titles Swiatek won, which is eight, and note that Djokovic's count isn't available in the provided information.\n</think>\n\nIga Swiatek won 8 titles in the 2022 season.

During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic.

With 9.7 million jobs added since President Biden took office and an average of 378,000 per month over the past three months, the economy continues to transition from a historically powerful recovery into steady and stable progress that benefits working families.

Health care jobs also saw strong growth, including in the nursing and residential care sector hit hard by the pandemic.

I'll start by looking at the documents provided. \n\nThe first document mentions ACL Festival with two weekends and various stages and performances. It also talks about tickets. Then, the second document says Apple is sponsoring the annual meeting of ACL, taking place in person from July 9, but the exact location isn't clear here. \n\nNext, the third document again talks about ACL Festival at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, happening over two weekends in October 2023. It mentions the festival growing to 9 stages and over 100 performances. \n\nThe fourth document gives specific dates: October 6-8 and 13-15, 2023, at Zilker Park. It also mentions that ticket prices will increase on May 16, 2023. \n\nThen, the fifth document provides a different location: Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, Canada, with an address and phone number. \n\nWait, so there are two different locations mentioned. One is Austin, TX, and the other is Toronto, Canada. Also, the dates are different. The festival in Austin is in October, while the Toronto event is just stated as ACL 2023 without specific dates. \n\nI think ACL might refer to two different events. One is the music festival in Austin, and the other is the Association for Computational Linguistics conference. The documents seem to conflate these two. The festival is in Austin in October, while the conference is in Toronto, but the exact dates for the conference aren't provided in the documents. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the ACL Festival (music event) is at Zilker Park, Austin, TX, on October 6-8 and 13-15, 2023. The ACL conference is at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, but the dates aren't specified here. However, since the question is about ACL 2023 without specifying which event, it's a bit confusing. \n\nBut looking back, the second document mentions the ACL annual meeting sponsored by Apple, taking place in person from July 9. That might be the conference, so perhaps the ACL 2023 conference is in Toronto around July 9, but the exact dates aren't provided. \n\nWait, the fifth document says ACL 2023 will take place at the Westin Harbour Castle, Toronto, but doesn't give the dates. The second document says it's from July 9, but doesn't specify the location. So maybe the conference is in Toronto from July 9, but the exact end date isn't given. \n\nSo, to answer the question: ACL 2023 (the conference) is taking place in Toronto at the Westin Harbour Castle, starting around July 9, 2023. The ACL Festival (music event) is in Austin, TX, on October 6-8 and 13-15, 2023. \n\nBut the question is about ACL 2023 in general, so I should probably mention both, but since the user might be referring to the conference, I'll focus on that. However, the documents don't provide the exact dates for the conference, only the location. \n\nWait, the second document says \"from July 9,\" but the fifth document just gives the location without dates. So perhaps the conference is from July 9 to an unspecified end date in Toronto. \n\nBut the user might be confused because ACL can refer to two events. So in the answer, I should clarify both. However, the question is when and where ACL 2023 is taking place, so I need to provide both the conference and the festival details if possible. \n\nBut the user might be referring to one or the other. Since the documents mention both, it's a bit conflicting. So I should probably state both, but the question might be about the conference, given the mention of the Association for Computational Linguistics. \n\nWait, the first part of the document talks about the festival, then the second part about the ACL conference. So the user's question is about ACL 2023, which could be either. \n\nI think the correct approach is to note that there are two events: the ACL Festival in Austin in October and the ACL conference in Toronto, with the conference starting July 9, 2023. But since the documents don't specify the exact dates beyond July 9 for the conference, I can only provide the start date for that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conference is from July 9 to 14, as that's a common conference duration, but that's an assumption. \n\nWait, checking the documents again, the fifth document only gives the location for ACL 2023 as Toronto, without dates. The second document says the ACL annual meeting is from July 9, but doesn't specify the location. So perhaps the conference is in Toronto from July 9, but the exact end date isn't provided. \n\nSo, in the answer, I should mention that ACL 2023 (the conference) is taking place in Toronto from July 9, 2023, at the Westin Harbour Castle. Additionally, the ACL Festival is happening in Austin in October 2023. \n\nBut the question is about ACL 2023, which could refer to either. So I should provide both, but perhaps the user is referring to the conference. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the first part of the document talks about the festival, and the latter part about the conference, the question might be about the conference, given the mention of the Association for Computational Linguistics. \n\nSo, to sum up, ACL 2023 (the conference) is in Toronto from July 9, 2023. The ACL Festival is in Austin in October 2023. \n\nBut the question is when and where ACL 2023 is taking place, so I should answer both. However, the user might be specifically referring to the conference. \n\nWait, the user's question is: \"When and where is ACL 2023 taking place?\" So, considering that ACL can refer to two events, but the documents mention both, perhaps the answer should clarify both. \n\nBut the user might not be aware of the two different events. So in the answer, I should mention both to avoid confusion. \n\nSo, the answer is: ACL 2023 refers to two events. The ACL Festival will take place at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, on October 6-8 and October 13-15, 2023. The ACL conference, sponsored by Apple, will take place in person from July 9, 2023, at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, Canada. \n\nWait, but the fifth document says ACL 2023 is at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, but doesn't specify the dates beyond the location. The second document says it's from July 9, but doesn't mention the location. So perhaps the conference is in Toronto from July 9 to 14, but that's an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conference is from July 9 to 15, but that's not stated. \n\nGiven the information, I should only state what's provided. So, the conference is in Toronto, with the address, and it starts on July 9, but the end date isn't specified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: ACL 2023 is taking place at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, Canada, starting on July 9, 2023. Additionally, the ACL Festival will occur at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, on October 6-8 and October 13-15, 2023. \n\nBut the question is about ACL 2023, so perhaps the user is referring to the conference, given the mention of the Association for Computational Linguistics in the second document. \n\nAlternatively, the user might be referring to the festival. \n\nGiven that, I think the best approach is to provide both, but clarify that ACL can refer to two different events. \n\nSo, in the answer, I should state both to avoid confusion. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ACL 2023 refers to two events. The ACL Festival will be held at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, on October 6-8 and October 13-15, 2023. The ACL conference, sponsored by Apple, will take place in person starting July 9, 2023, at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, Canada.\n</think>\n\nThe ACL 2023 events are as follows:\n\n- **ACL Festival**: This will take place at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, on two weekends: October 6-8 and October 13-15, 2023.\n- **ACL Conference**: Sponsored by Apple, it will be held at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, Canada, starting on July 9, 2023.

{"id": 41, "query": "When and where did Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral take place?", "ans": ["Westminster Abbey", "September 19"], "label": [1, 1], "prediction": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out when and where Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral took place. Let me go through the documents provided to find the relevant information. \n\nFirst, I'll scan each document for keywords like \"funeral, date, location.\" \n\nIn the first document, it says that after the funeral, she will be buried at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. It mentions the funeral was the largest security operation ever in the UK and was attended by many dignitaries. It also notes that the funeral was on a public holiday in the UK and some Commonwealth states. \n\nThe second document provides more details. It mentions the state funeral was on September 19, 2022. It describes the procession to St. George's Chapel and the committal service there. It also talks about a private ceremony later in the evening at the King George VI Memorial Chapel where she was laid to rest beside Prince Philip.\n\nAnother part of the document confirms the funeral took place on September 19, 2022, with the coffin being lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel. \n\nSo, putting this together, the state funeral was on September 19, 2022, and it took place at Westminster Abbey, but the committal service was at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Wait, actually, I need to clarify: the main funeral service was at Westminster Abbey, but the committal service, where she was laid to rest, was at St. George's Chapel. \n\nWait, no, looking again, the document says that on September 19, the coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel. Also, the committal service was at St. George's Chapel with 800 attendees. Then, later that evening, a private ceremony was held at the King George VI Memorial Chapel within Windsor Castle, where she was laid to rest beside Prince Philip.\n\nSo, the state funeral itself, the main event, was held at Westminster Abbey, but the committal service and burial were at St. George's Chapel. However, the document also mentions that the state funeral was on September 19, and the coffin was processed to St. George's Chapel for the committal service. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the venues. Let me check again: the document says the state funeral was on September 19, and the coffin was taken to St. George's Chapel for the committal service. So, the funeral was at Westminster Abbey, but the committal service was at St. George's Chapel, and then she was laid to rest in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, which is part of St. George's Chapel complex.\n\nSo, the state funeral took place on September 19, 2022, with the main service at Westminster Abbey, and then the coffin was taken to St. George's Chapel for the committal service and burial in the memorial chapel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire state funeral was at St. George's Chapel. Wait, no, because the document mentions the coffin being taken from Westminster Abbey to St. George's Chapel. So, the state funeral was the service at Westminster Abbey, and then the committal at St. George's Chapel.\n\nWait, no, the document says: \"Queen Elizabeth II's coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel... to Westminster Abbey, where her funeral will take place.\" Hmm, that might be a typo. Wait, the correct order is that the coffin was taken from Westminster Abbey to St. George's Chapel. So, the state funeral service was at Westminster Abbey, and then the coffin was processed to St. George's Chapel for the committal service.\n\nBut in another part, it says: \"the state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dinitaries from around the world.\" So, the state funeral was the main event, which was at Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022, and then the committal service and burial at St. George's Chapel.\n\nWait, but the document also says: \"On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London...\" which is a different event. \n\nAnother part says: \"Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.\" So, that's about her health, not the funeral.\n\nIn the second document, it's stated that the state funeral was on September 19, 2022. It mentions that the coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel, and that the funeral would take place at Westminster Abbey. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me read it again: \"Queen Elizabeth II's coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel... to Westminster Abbey, where her funeral will take place.\" That seems like it's saying the coffin was moved from Westminster Abbey to St. George's Chapel, but that might be a translation error or confusion.\n\nWait, perhaps the coffin was taken from Westminster Abbey to St. George's Chapel for the committal service after the funeral. So, the state funeral was at Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022, and then the coffin was taken to St. George's Chapel for the committal service and burial.\n\nBut another part of the document says: \"The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dinitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states.\" That refers to the state funeral, which was the main event at Westminster Abbey.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the state funeral took place on September 19, 2022, at Westminster Abbey, and then the committal service was held at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, where she was laid to rest alongside Prince Philip.\n\nWait, but another part of the document says: \"the state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dinitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts...\"\n\nThen, further down: \"Queen Elizabeth II's coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel... to Westminster Abbey, where her funeral will take place.\" Hmm, that seems like the order is reversed. Maybe the coffin was at Westminster Abbey for the funeral and then moved to St. George's Chapel for burial.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to parse the exact wording: \"Queen Elizabeth II's coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel... to Westminster Abbey, where her funeral will take place.\" That seems like a mistake because the coffin can't be lowered into the crypt before the funeral. It must be that the coffin was taken from Westminster Abbey to St. George's Chapel after the funeral service.\n\nSo, the state funeral was at Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022, and then the coffin was processed to St. George's Chapel for the committal service and burial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire state funeral, including the service and committal, was at St. George's Chapel. But that doesn't align with common knowledge, as Westminster Abbey is the traditional venue for state funerals.\n\nWait, in the document, it says: \"the state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK...\" and that the funeral was on September 19, 2022. It also mentions that the coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's Chapel on that day.\n\nSo, perhaps the state funeral service was at Westminster Abbey, and then the coffin was taken to St. George's Chapel for the committal service and burial.\n\nBut the document also says: \"the procession is expected to reach the steps of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The queen's coffin will be taken from the state hearse and carried in procession into the chapel for the committal service.\" So, the committal service was at St. George's Chapel, which is part of the state funeral proceedings.\n\nTherefore, the state funeral took place on September 19, 2022, with the main service at Westminster Abbey and the committal service at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, where she was laid to rest.\n\nWait, but the document also says: \"the state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dinitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts...\"\n\nSo, the state funeral was the main event, which was held at Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022. Then, the committal service was at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, where she was buried alongside Prince Philip.\n\nSo, to answer the question: When and where did Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral take place? The state funeral took place on September 19, 2022, at Westminster Abbey in London, and the committal service was held at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, where she was laid to rest.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking for the state funeral's location. So, the state funeral was at Westminster Abbey, and the burial was at St. George's Chapel. But the document says that the state funeral included the committal service at St. George's Chapel. So, perhaps the entire state funeral process included both venues.\n\nAlternatively, the main state funeral service was at Westminster Abbey, and the committal service was at St. George's Chapel, both on the same day, September 19, 2022.\n\nSo, to answer the question accurately, the state funeral took place on September 19, 2022, at Westminster Abbey, London, and the committal service followed at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the state funeral, so the main service was at Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022.\n</think>\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's state funeral took place on September 19, 2022, at Westminster Abbey in London.

However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip.

Prosecutors said results of his mental evaluation showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.

Japan’s longest serving prime minister, he was also perhaps the most polarizing, complex politician in recent Japanese history. Abe, who was assassinated Friday, angered both liberals at home and World War II victims in Asia with his hawkish push to revamp the military and his revisionist view that Japan was given an unfair verdict by history for its brutal past. At the same time, he revitalized Japan’s economy, led efforts for the nation to take a stronger role in Asia and served as a rare beacon of political stability before stepping down two years ago for health reasons. “He’s the most towering political figure in Japan over the past couple of decades,” said Dave Leheny, a political scientist at Waseda University. “He wanted Japan to be respected on the global stage in the way that he felt was deserved. ...

The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time.

We’ve listed the full specifications of the 4090 below. You’ll be able to find extensive benchmarks of the GPU in our full review.  According to Nvidia’s own benchmarks, the GPU can produce the following results compared against a system using an i9-12900k, equipped with a 3090 Ti with 32GB of RAM.

In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS.

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made.

And due to Netflix's recent crackdown on password sharing in the US, it now costs an additional $8 a month to add an extra user to your account. The fee will only apply to users who live outside of an account holder's household. This year, Netflix announced another major change to its subscriptions: After 25 years, the streaming service is shuttering its DVD-rental services in September — an early part of Netflix's history that became synonymous with its red envelopes. The platform also recently removed its ad-free Basic plan, which means the its cheapest ad-free plan now starts at $15.49 a month. To help you decide which Netflix plan is right you, we've put together a guide detailing how much Netflix charges for each of its membership tiers. Netflix currently offers three streaming plans: Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium, starting at $7 a month and ending at $20 a month. It will cost more to add another user to a subscription plan.", "Netflix’s ad tier is cheaper than those of a number of its fellow streamers. Disney+ and Hulu’s ad plans will both be $7.99 per month when Disney+’s ad tier launches in December, while HBO Max with ads is $9.99 per month.

It also quotes White House spokesman Andrew Bates on Democratic agenda items and their impact on the election. This suggests that Democrats were highlighting their achievements, which might have helped in the elections.\n\nThe document then talks about Former President Trump claiming irregularities in vote counting in Nevada and Arizona, but without evidence.

It also notes that in 2022, 33 districts were toss-ups, making the election close.\n\nAnother section discusses historical data from 1934-2018, showing that the incumbent party loses seats, but in 2022, the job growth was good, while inflation was high.

It mentions that if Democrats kept both, they'd restart Biden's agenda, but since the document doesn't say they did, perhaps the Senate remained Democratic. Alternatively, maybe the Senate was split, but without explicit info, it's unclear.

There's a section about the USMNT needing to win against Iran to clinch a berth in the Round of 16. It mentions their game against Iran on November 29, which was their third group stage match. The document also talks about the USA's previous games, including a draw against England and a match against Wales. Wait, no, the Wales part might be about Iran's match, not the USA's. Let me check that again.\n\nLooking back, the document says that Iran played Wales and scored two late goals to keep their advancement hopes alive. So the USA's group stage opponents were England, Iran, and Iran's other opponent was Wales. But I'm not sure if the USA played Wales. Wait, no, the USA's group included England, Iran, and the third team might have been someone else. Let me think. The document mentions the USA's group stage matches as being against England and Iran, but I'm not sure about the third team. Maybe it's Wales? Or perhaps another team.

So the USA played Wales in their first match, then England, then Iran.\n\nAfter the group stage, if they advanced, they would go to the Round of 16. So the document mentions that the USA needed to beat Iran to make it to the Round of 16. So after beating Iran, the USA would have advanced. Then, in the Round of 16, they played against the Netherlands. The document mentions that the Netherlands had some players with flu symptoms and that there was a tactical preview about the USA's midfield against the Netherlands. So that must mean the USA played the Netherlands in the Round of 16.\n\nAs for Germany, the document says that Germany made a stunning exit despite defeating Costa Rica 4-2. They couldn't make up for their opening loss against Japan. So in their group, Germany played Japan and Costa Rica. But wait, the Round of 16 is after the group stage. If Germany lost in the group stage, they might not have made it to the Round of 16. But the document says they exited early despite defeating Costa Rica, so maybe they were eliminated in the group stage. Therefore, Germany might not have played in the Round of 16. But let me confirm. The 2022 World Cup group stage for Germany was in a group that included Japan, Spain, and Costa Rica. They lost to Japan and then tied with Spain, and then beat Costa Rica but still got eliminated because of goal difference. So they didn't make it to the Round of 16.\n\nWait, but the question is about who the USA and Germany played in the Round of 16. If Germany didn't make it out of the group, they didn't play anyone in the Round of 16. So the USA played the Netherlands, and Germany didn't play anyone because they were eliminated.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss any info in the document. The document mentions that Germany made an early exit despite defeating Costa Rica, so they didn't advance.

Billy's foster bestie is Freddy (the scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), a kid on crutches with a smart mouth on him. Things have changed for Billy and his orphaned buds -- Mary (Grace Caroline Currey), Eugene (Ian Chen), Pedro (Jovan Armand) and Darla (a fab Faithe Herman) -- ever since the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) picked him as his successor. \"Put your hands on my staff,\" demanded the Wiz. \"Gross!\" said Billy, in a response that typified the script's \"Deadpool\"-lite irreverence.

And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world.

Google Bard was first announced in February 2023. After being announced, Google Bard remained open to a limited amount of users, based on a queue in a waitlist. But at Google I/O 2023, the company announced that Bard was now open to everyone, which includes 180 countries and territories around the world. Bard is also now available in Japanese and Korean, with up to 40 languages to be supported soon, according to Google.

What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset.

Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet.

But we do know that its colorful visuals will return this time around, just like its predecessors. However, its second Direct trailer would go into much more depth. That second clip introduces some of the sequel’s new features. Pikmin 4 will introduce a new ice Pikmin type that’s capable of freezing water, giving all Pikmin safe passage. The biggest revelation, though, is that the game will feature an adorable dog-like companion that can aid Captain Olimar. In the trailer, we see it dragging an item back to Olimar’s ship all by itself, seemingly confirming that it has the power of 10 Pikmin.

Pikmin 4 is set to launch for the Nintendo Switch on July 21 and marks the newest numbered entry in the real-time strategy series in over ten years, making its release quite the big deal for hardcore fans. Instead of playing as Captain Olimar (who most people know from Super Smash Bros. at this point) or any of his space explorer comrades, gamers will get to customize their own character (a series first). There are not too many options available, but it's still a step forward in terms of a character creator in a Nintendo first-party title. Pikmin 4 comes out in a couple of days and retails for $59.99, the same price as most other major games on the Switch.

Speaking of new Pikmin, the Glow Pikmin will let you explore the world at night — a first for the series. This type only shows up after dark and can combine together into a large green orb to launch at airborne enemies. Finally, the Dandori Battles will let you compete against other players to gather the most objects within the time limit to save the castaway and win. Pikmin 4 is now available to preorder at major retailers and the Nintendo eShop. It’ll cost $60, unlike The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game will also be eligible to purchase with Nintendo’s Switch Game Voucher system. The Pikmin series has always highlighted the idea of commanding huge numbers of tiny creatures at once.

This installment introduces a new Ice Pikmin that can freeze enemies and the environment to help your alien flora navigate the strange planet they find themselves on. The plants aren’t alone this time around, either, as they get help from a rotund dog called Oatchi, who can smash through barriers and carry Pikmin on its back while swimming across ponds and puddles.

A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail.

Also in the supporting actress category is Hong Chau, who plays the best friend of Brendan Fraser's title character in The Whale.

{"id": 81, "query": "Who won the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the 95th Academy Awards Ceremony?", "ans": ["Michelle Yeoh", "Jamie Lee Curtis"], "label": [1, 1], "prediction": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out who won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the 95th Academy Awards. I'll start by looking through the provided document to see if that information is there.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the document. I see mentions of Jamie Lee Curtis grabbing the mic before entering the press room. That suggests she might have won something. Since she's an actress, it's likely she won either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress. The document also mentions her entering the press room to take questions, which usually happens after someone has won an award.\n\nLooking further, I see that the Best Original Song was awarded to \"Naatu Naatu\" from \"RRR.\" That's not relevant here. Then, there's a mention of Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan winning Best Original Screenplay for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" Again, not directly related to the acting categories.\n\nThe document also talks about the In Memoriam tribute, which includes Angela Lansbury. She's a well-known actress, but since she passed away, she wouldn't be winning an award that year. \n\nI also notice that the film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won several awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It's possible that the actresses from this film were nominated, but I need to check if they won.\n\nLooking through the document again, I see that Jamie Lee Curtis is mentioned as the Best Supporting Actress winner. That's one part of the answer. Now, for Best Actress, the document doesn't explicitly mention the winner. It talks about Michelle Yeoh in the context of the film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" but it doesn't state that she won Best Actress. However, since the film won several awards, it's possible she did, but the document doesn't confirm it.\n\nWait, the document does mention that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won seven awards, but it specifically lists the categories it didn't win: costume design, original score, and best song. It doesn't mention Best Actress, so maybe Michelle Yeoh won that. But the document doesn't explicitly say so. \n\nI also see that Ruth E. Carter won Best Costume Design for \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" but that's another category. \n\nSince the document doesn't provide the Best Actress winner, I can't confirm it from the given text. However, I know from general knowledge that Michelle Yeoh won Best Actress for her role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" at the 95th Oscars. But since the document doesn't mention it, I have to rely on the information given.\n\nWait, the document does mention that Jamie Lee Curtis won Best Supporting Actress, as she's the one who grabbed the mic. For Best Actress, the document doesn't provide the name, so I can't answer that part based on the given information. However, since the user is asking for both categories, and the document only provides the Supporting Actress, I might have to say that the information isn't sufficient for Best Actress.\n\nBut wait, the document does mention that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won seven awards, and it's possible that Michelle Yeoh was among them, but it's not explicitly stated. So, I can't be certain from the document alone. Therefore, I should state that the document doesn't provide the Best Actress winner but does mention Jamie Lee Curtis as Best Supporting Actress.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The document starts by mentioning Jamie Lee Curtis as the Best Supporting Actress winner. Then, under the original song section, it talks about \"RRR.\" Later, it mentions the screenplay awards. Then, it discusses the box office numbers of the Best Picture nominees. It also mentions that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won seven awards but doesn't specify which ones beyond screenplay and best picture.\n\nIn the section about the morning of the ceremony, it talks about Gaga performing and Glenn Close canceling. Then, it goes into the box office numbers. Later, it mentions that the space is no longer being updated and provides links. Then, it says that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won seven awards, missing out on costume design, original score, and best song. So, the seven awards include Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress (Jamie Lee Curtis), Best Actress (Michelle Yeoh), Best Editing, and possibly another category.\n\nWait, the document does mention that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won seven awards, and since Jamie Lee Curtis is part of that film, she won Best Supporting Actress. It's reasonable to infer that Michelle Yeoh won Best Actress, even though the document doesn't explicitly state it. But since the document doesn't mention her name in the context of winning, I can't be certain. Therefore, I should only confirm Jamie Lee Curtis as Best Supporting Actress and state that the document doesn't provide the Best Actress winner.\n\nBut wait, the document does mention that \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" won seven awards, and it's a well-known fact that Michelle Yeoh won Best Actress for that film. However, since the document doesn't explicitly say so, I have to stick to what's written. Therefore, I can only confirm Jamie Lee Curtis as Best Supporting Actress and cannot provide the Best Actress winner from the given document.\n</think>\n\nThe Best Supporting Actress at the 95th Academy Awards was Jamie Lee Curtis.

Let me start by reading through each document carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the document about Hasbro, it mentions that Chris Cocks has been named the new CEO. He was previously the president and COO of Wizards of the Coast and the digital gaming division. He took over from Rich Stoddart, who was the interim CEO. So, as of February 25, Chris Cocks is the CEO of Hasbro.\n\nNow, moving on to Burberry. The document talks about some C-suite changes. It mentions that Jonathan Akeroyd is the new CEO who arrived six months prior. There's also a mention of Julie Brown leaving her position as CFO, but that's not relevant to the CEO role. The document doesn't mention any changes to the CEO position beyond Akeroyd, so it seems he is still the CEO of Burberry.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the documents. Both CEOs are clearly stated: Chris Cocks for Hasbro and Jonathan Akeroyd for Burberry. There's no indication of any errors in the facts provided, so I can confidently state both CEOs based on the given information.\n</think>\n\nThe CEOs of the companies mentioned are:\n\n- **Hasbro**: Chris Cocks\n- **Burberry**: Jonathan Akeroyd", "docs": ["Chris’s extensive omni-channel experience and proven track record make him the ideal leader for Hasbro as it continues to become the world’s leading play and entertainment company. On behalf of the Board, we thank Rich for serving as Interim CEO during a difficult time for the Hasbro family and are delighted he will serve as Chair of our Board.”   Mr. Stoddart said: “Having known Chris for years and working more closely with him these last several months, I have no doubt that he will be an extraordinary leader for the next phase of Hasbro’s journey. A storyteller and gamer at heart, Chris innately understands how to create and nurture brands to drive fan and consumer connection across channels. He is a highly strategic leader, with the vision, skills and experience to unlock our Brand Blueprint for supercharged growth.”   Mr. Cocks said: “Hasbro has amazing brands, gifted storytellers and unique entertainment assets, and I am humbled to step into the position of CEO at this important time and to build on the strong foundation Brian created. Our consumer products, gaming and entertainment teams are the best and most creative in the business and have shown such incredible resilience. I look forward to working with our highly-experienced senior management team as we continue to reimagine play and entertainment and deliver experiences to families and fans, of all ages, around the world.”   Mr.", "Prior to joining Hasbro, Chris held senior management positions at Microsoft Corporation, where he guided the marketing strategies of hit Xbox Games franchises including Halo and served as Vice President of OEM Technical Sales. He also worked at LeapFrog as Vice President of Educational Games and began his career in brand management at Procter & Gamble. Chris graduated from Harvard University in 1996. He serves on the Board of Trustees of The Paley Center for Media, the leading nonprofit dedicated to celebrating the cultural, creative, and social significance of media and its impact on society.    As Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Hasbro, Inc., Gina Goetter oversees the Company’s global business and corporate financial operations – including treasury, tax, investor relations, internal audit, accounting and control, supply chain operations and data insights, and business planning and analysis.

During her time at Harley Davidson, Gina led the Company through a multi-year strategic transformation focused on restoring growth and profitability across the core business and reinvigorating total shareholder return.", "By Sarah Shannon and Kati Chitrakorn The news, which sent Burberry’s share price down nearly 4 per cent in morning trading, comes six months after the arrival of new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd. More C-suite changes are expected: rumours have been circulating that Akeroyd is seeking a new chief creative officer to replace Riccardo Tisci, whose contract is due to expire in early 2023. Still, analysts were surprised by Brown’s exit. “While not an industry insider, Julie has definitely the merit of having promoted an unswerving focus on cost efficiency,” says Luca Solca, senior analyst at consultancy Bernstein, in a note. “This departure adds to the ‘to do’ list of Jonathan Akeroyd, as media reports indicate he is trying to recruit a new creative director as well. We think new and more original creative energy could benefit Burberry. The CFO departure at this point seems an outright setback, though.” Flavio Cereda, MD and analyst at financial services company Jeffries, writes: “No reasons have been disclosed for her decision to exit the group she joined six years ago, but it implies a further clean slate for new CEO Jonathan Akeroyd ahead of his strategic presentation (relaunch) in November.” “Julie has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth, supported by a high-quality team,” a statement from Akeroyd reads.

The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos). This time last year, we saw the arrival of Magic Eraser, which lets you remove unwanted people or objects from your photos with a flick of your finger.", "Strabag SE used Azure OpenAI Service to create a solution that helps identify the potential impacts of new construction projects—and mitigate risks at the outset.

But worry not, Google says it’ll 'give select Pixel phones early access to Magic Editor later this year.' Who exactly will get access and when, we can’t say. So be sure to keep an eye on Google’s blog for additional updates. I think a lot of the resentment directed at A.I. is because it makes tasks that used to take effort and skill almost effortless.

The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels. Like previous years, Google also teased the event with a binary field puzzle that fans had to solve to reveal the launch date. Googgle I/O 20213 took place on 10 May. The keynote occurred at 10am PT and lasted about two hours. Google I/O 2023 was broadcast online and is still available to everyone to watch.

But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board,” he said. Mr. Cook also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent visit. Mr. Cook also took to Twitter and said, “Thank you, Prime Minister @narendramodi for the warm welcome. We share your vision of the positive impact technology can make on India's future — from education and developers to manufacturing and the environment, we're committed to growing and investing across the country.” Mr. Cook had last visited India in 2016 when the tech giant began scaling up operations in the country.

That store’s barricades lifted on Tuesday. The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. On Apple earnings calls, Cook has stressed India’s importance as a market and production base. During the latest such conference, Cook said Apple set “a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year” in the country. “India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,” Cook said on the call. “I’m very bullish on India.” --With assistance from Mark Gurman.", "The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

To handle these pressures, Diggins’ approach was quite different from the “eye on the prize” medal-focus one might expect. “For me, it was just important to make sure I could still focus on the process. And so I wasn’t focused on winning, I wasn’t focused on metals, I was just focused on doing my best every single day. So I could come here prepared and happy and in a good place.” And it worked.
