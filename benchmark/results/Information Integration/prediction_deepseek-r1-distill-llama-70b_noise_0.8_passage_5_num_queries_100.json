Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

By Gabe Cohn The 94th Academy Awards were held on Sunday night at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. “CODA,” a relatively small-scale drama once considered an underdog, won the award for best picture, becoming the first film distributed by a streaming service to win Hollywood’s top honor. (“CODA” was released by Apple TV+, which purchased the movie after it played at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021.) The night’s most awarded movie was “Dune,” which won in six categories including cinematography and production design. The best director honor went to Jane Campion, whose subversive western, “The Power of the Dog,” was the most nominated movie of the night. Campion’s victory was important for Oscars history: This year’s ceremony became the first time that the best director Oscar has gone to women twice in a row. (Chloé Zhao won last year for “Nomadland”; Campion had already made history by being the first woman to be nominated for best director twice.)

He defeated 24-year-old Norwegian clay specialist Casper Ruud 7-6(1), 6-3, 7-5. The 36-year-old is the first man to win at least three titles at each of the four majors. He and Serena Williams now share the tie for most Grand Slam titles behind Australian record-holder Margaret Court, who won 24 major women's singles titles. Ruud started strong, winning the first three games before Djokovic won his first. The opening losses weren't new for the Serbian star. It’s not the rope-a-dope, exactly, but he has lost the first set of major matches before and has almost always come storming back to even the score and crush his opponent. On Sunday he came back in the first set itself, tying Ruud 4-4 before forcing a tiebreak. That’s when Djokovic Prime activated. He won the tiebreak easily and then had a chance to rest before the second set started.

Let me go through the provided documents step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Swiatek's information. The document mentions that she won three Grand Slam titles in 2022. Additionally, during her 37-match win streak, she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles: Qatar, Indian Wells, and Miami. That's three more titles, so that's six titles so far. However, I should check if these are all in 2022. Since the document says she started the 2023 season by leading in the United Cup, the titles mentioned before that are from 2022. So, Swiatek has at least six titles in 2022.\n\nNow, looking at Djokovic's information. The document states that in 2022, he won at least five titles in 11 different tournaments, including two ATP 500s (Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona) and one ATP 250. Wait, actually, reading it again: \"Novak Djokovic has now won at least five titles in 11 different ... and two ATP 500s (Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona), while Djokovic won one...\" It seems a bit confusing. Let me parse that correctly. It says he won at least five titles across 11 different tournaments, including two ATP 500s and one ATP 250. So that would be a total of at least five titles in 2022.\n\nWait, no, the wording is a bit unclear. The document says, \"Novak Djokovic has now won at least five titles in 11 different ... and two ATP 500s (Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona), while Djokovic won one...\" It might be that he won two ATP 500s and one ATP 250, totaling at least three titles. But the initial part says he's won at least five titles in 11 different categories. I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-read that part:\n\n\"Novak Djokovic has now won at least five titles in 11 different ... and two ATP 500s (Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona), while Djokovic won one...\"\n\nIt seems like he has won at least five titles across 11 different tournaments, which include two ATP 500s and one ATP 250. So that would make at least five titles in total for Djokovic in 2022.\n\nWait, no, the way it's written is that he has won at least five titles in 11 different categories, and specifically mentions two ATP 500s and one ATP 250. So perhaps the total is more than five. But the exact number isn't clearly stated. The document doesn't specify the exact number of titles Djokovic won in 2022, just that he won at least five, including two ATP 500s and one ATP 250. So I can't determine the exact number beyond that.\n\nTherefore, Swiatek won at least six titles in 2022, and Djokovic won at least five. But since the question is about the total each has won, and the documents don't provide the exact numbers beyond that, I have to state what's given.\n\nWait, no, the document says Swiatek won three Grand Slams and three 1000-level titles, totaling six. For Djokovic, it mentions he won at least five titles in 11 different tournaments, including two ATP 500s and one ATP 250. So the minimum is five, but possibly more. However, without exact numbers beyond that, I can only confirm that Swiatek won six titles and Djokovic won at least five.\n\nBut wait, the question is how many titles each has won in 2022. The documents specify Swiatek's titles clearly: three Grand Slams and three 1000-level titles, so six in total. For Djokovic, the document says he's won at least five titles in 11 different tournaments, including two ATP 500s and one ATP 250. So he has at least five, but possibly more.

So that's two plus one, totaling three, but the document says at least five. So perhaps he has more than that. But without the exact number, I can only state that Swiatek won six titles and Djokovic won at least five in 2022.\n\nBut the question is asking for both. So I need to present both numbers as per the documents. Swiatek has six, Djokovic has at least five. But maybe the document also mentions that Djokovic won one ATP 250, so that's one, plus two ATP 500s, so three, and perhaps two more to make five.

She didn’t just rise to No 1, she ran the table on tour and changed our perception of what dominance looks like on the WTA tour. Now that it’s over, we take a closer look at the stats that defined it.  Iga Swiatek’s 2022 was a thrill ride of epic proportions. The Polish juggernaut captivated the tennis world from start to finish and became the most dominant player in the game over the last 10 months, as she wrote the early chapters in what is sure to be a voluminous tome of statistics by the end of her career.  For now, as Swiatek enjoys some well-deserved rest and relaxation at home, we go inside the numbers of her mind-boggling season.  1 – Swiatek became the WTA’s 28th No.1-ranked player on April 4 (and the first Polish world No 1) and dominated from there. She produced a 41-6 record as the No 1 and has held the top ranking for 31 weeks.  2 – Number of Grand Slam titles won, Swiatek is the first player to win more than one in a single season since 2016.  3 – Number of Grand Slam titles won in 2022 by Swiatek.", "The 2022 Iga Świątek tennis season officially began on 3 January 2022 as the start of the 2022 WTA Tour.

But it is a valuable life experience for me and something that as I said will stay there, but I have to move on.\" If Djokovic were to win, he would tie Nadal with 22 major titles, and be just one behind Serena Williams for the most in the Open era. As if there wasn't enough already on the line for him or anything. Prior to Carlos Alcaraz's withdrawal last week due to a right leg injury, it looked as if both of the reigning US Open champions would be looking for back-to-back major titles. But alas, that is not to be. But while Alcaraz won't be there, Swiatek certainly will be, and she will be attempting to cement her status as the heir apparent for tennis' superstar title. With Williams and Federer already retired, and Djokovic and Nadal nearing the ends of their careers, and in the absence of Alcaraz, all eyes will squarely be on her to step into those ever-so-large shoes.", "The 21-year-old has already won three major titles and firmly held onto the top ranking since Barty retired in April. As a two-time French Open champion, her dominance on clay has been evident for some time, but she proved she is just as dominant on the hard courts in 2022. During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic. Although she was handed a stunning 6-2, 6-2 loss by Jessica Pegula in the semis, the normally unflappable Swiatek will likely use that as motivation in Melbourne."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

The company's Q3 2022 earnings were released last night, and they show a 27 percent drop in profits compared to last year, with weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue.

Profits were at $13.9 billion, down from $18.9 billion in Q3 2021. As usual, Alphabet earnings are mostly about Google ad revenue and click-through rates, with the company citing reduced spending from the \"insurance, loan, mortgage, and crypto subcategories\" in particular. Worries about the economy and inflation are causing many Google customers to cut their ad budgets.

Scanning through the text, I see the name Kiersey Clemons mentioned right at the beginning. It says, \"College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast.\" That clearly indicates Kiersey Clemons plays Susie Wallis.\n\nNext, I need to find out who the director is. Looking through the document, there are several names listed, including some that are bolded. Names like Abraham Chan, Madeline Rocco, Samantha Hawkins, Joanna Levinger, Meredith Tucker, Sophie Kargman, David Newhouse, Jamie Fairweather, Conor Murphy, and others. Wait, Conor Murphy is listed as the cinematographer, so he's not the director.\n\nI also see that Sophie Kargman is mentioned as the screenwriter, and she's also listed as one of the crew members. Wait, in one part, it says, \"Kargman and Day Frank...\" which might refer to Sophie Kargman and someone else, maybe a co-director or writer. But I'm not sure. Let me check again.\n\nLooking further down, there's a mention of \"Kargman and William Day Frank smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals...\" So, Sophie Kargman and William Day Frank are involved in the writing or direction. But the question is about the director.\n\nWait, in the initial part, it says, \"Susie Searches is thus a quirky look...\" and then later, \"Sophie Kargman and William Day Frank smartly pivoted...\" which suggests they might be the writers or possibly co-directors. But I don't see a direct mention of a director's name. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the credits section, it lists several people, but the only name under \"Cinematographer\" is Conor Murphy. The others are in roles like Art Director, Set Decoration, Costume Design, etc. There's no specific mention of a director in the provided document. However, in the first paragraph, the name Sophie Kargman is mentioned as the screenwriter, and in another part, she's referred to as working with William Day Frank. But without a clear director's name, I might have to infer.\n\nWait, perhaps the director isn't explicitly mentioned here. Let me check again. The document starts with a review or analysis of the movie, mentioning the actress and some crew, but the director's name isn't clearly stated. So maybe the document doesn't provide that information.\n\nAlternatively, in the second part, the document says, \"In 2020's 'Susie Searches,' she also starred as the brace-faced sleuth. However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank smartly pivoted...\" So, perhaps Sophie Kargman is the writer, and William Day Frank is the director? Or maybe they are both writers. It's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, in the initial part, after the first paragraph, there's a list of crew members. The first name is Abraham Chan as Art Director, then Madeline Rocco as Set Decoration, Samantha Hawkins as Costume Design, Joanna Levinger as Casting, Meredith Tucker as Casting, Sophie Kargman as Screenwriter, David Newhouse as Executive Producer, Jamie Fairweather as Executive Producer, Conor Murphy as Cinematographer.\n\nSo Sophie Kargman is the Screenwriter, and Conor Murphy is the Cinematographer. The director's name isn't listed here. So, perhaps the document doesn't provide the director's name.\n\nWait, maybe the director is Sophie Kargman? Sometimes the screenwriter also directs. Let me check the second part again. It says, \"Kargman and William Day Frank smartly pivoted...\" So maybe they co-wrote it, but not necessarily directed it.\n\nWait, in the absence of the director's name in the document, I might have to say that the information isn't provided. But wait, the initial part of the document says, \"Sep 22, 2022 ... College student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has her own true crime podcast,...\" and then the review mentions \"Kargman and William Day Frank smartly pivoted...\" So perhaps Sophie Kargman is the writer, but the director isn't mentioned.\n\nWait, let me think again. The document might not mention the director's name at all. So, in that case, I can't answer the question about the director because it's not provided. But the user is asking for both the actress and the director.\n\nWait, in the initial part, the document starts with \"Susie Searches plays on our societal love for true crime...\" and then in the second paragraph, it says, \"Susie Searches is thus a quirky look...\" and later, \"Sophie Kargman and William Day Frank smartly pivoted...\" So, perhaps Sophie Kargman is the director? Or maybe she's the writer. It's unclear.\n\nWait, in the document, under the crew list, Sophie Kargman is listed as Screenwriter. So she wrote the screenplay. The director's name isn't listed. Therefore, the document doesn't provide the director's name.\n\nWait, but in the second part, it says, \"For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated...\" and then, \"Kargman and Day Frank smartly pivoted...\" So, perhaps the director is someone else, but the document doesn't mention it.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided document, Kiersey Clemons plays Susie Wallis, and the director's name isn't provided. So I can answer the first part, but not the second.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for both. So, in that case, I can only provide the actress's name and state that the director's information isn't available in the document.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed the director's name. Let me scan the document again. The crew list includes various roles, but no director is mentioned. So, the answer would be that Kiersey Clemons plays Susie Wallis, and the director isn't specified in the provided document.\n</think>\n\nThe actress who plays Susie Wallis is Kiersey Clemons.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for.

All rights reserved.", "In 2020's \"Susie Searches,\" she also starred as the brace-faced sleuth. However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.", "When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

The top-ranked player is the player who, over the previous 52 weeks, has garnered the most ranking points on the ATP Tour. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in tournaments and the category of those tournaments.

Since 1973, 28 players have been ranked No. 1 by the ATP,[3][4] of which 17 have been year-end No. 1.  The current world number one is Carlos Alcaraz.  Since the introduction of the rankings, the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times. As of 2019, the rankings are calculated by totaling the points a player wins in his best eighteen tournaments, subject to certain restrictions. For top players the counting tournaments are the four Grand Slam tournaments, the eight mandatory ATP Masters tournaments, the non-mandatory ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo, the player's best four eligible ATP Tour 500 tournaments and his best two results from ATP Tour 250 tournaments.", "These tables present the number of singles (S), doubles (D), and mixed doubles (X) titles won by each player and each nation during the season, within all the tournament categories of the 2022 calendar : the Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP Finals, the ATP Tour Masters 1000, the ATP Tour 500 tournaments, and the ATP Tour 250 tournaments.

This document also provides a table with annual inflation rates from 2000 to 2023, but I'm specifically looking for August data, so I'm not sure if this helps directly.\n\nNext, there's another document that discusses U.S. consumer price increases easing in August compared to the previous year. It states that the inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% in August, which is down from 8.5% in July and 9.1% in June. This seems to be the inflation rate for August, but I need to confirm if this is the correct year. The document is from September 13, 2022, so it's referring to August 2022. However, the user didn't specify the year, but since the first document mentions 2023, maybe they're asking about August 2023. I'm a bit confused here because the documents mention different years.\n\nLooking further, I see a document from The Wall Street Journal about U.S. inflation in August 2022. It mentions that the inflation rate was 8.3%, which aligns with the previous document. This seems consistent, so I can note that the inflation rate for August 2022 was 8.3%. But again, if the question is about 2023, this might not be relevant.\n\nNow, regarding the unemployment rate, none of the provided documents mention it. The documents focus on inflation rates, consumer prices, and related economic indicators but do not provide any data on unemployment. Therefore, I can't find the unemployment rate for August in the given information.\n\nTo summarize, the inflation rate for August 2022 was 8.3%, but I don't have the data for August 2023. The unemployment rate isn't mentioned at all in the documents. Since the user didn't specify the year, it's a bit unclear, but based on the documents, I can only provide the 2022 inflation rate and state that unemployment data isn't available.\n</think>\n\nThe inflation rate in the U.S. for August 2022 was 8.3%. However, the unemployment rate for August is not provided in the available documents. If you are inquiring about a different year, please specify for further clarification. \n\nAnswer: The inflation rate in August was 8.3%, but the unemployment rate is not provided in the documents.", "docs": ["The annual inflation rate for the United States was 3.0% for the 12 months ended June, according to U.S. Labor Department data published on July 12, 2023.

The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.  Stock investors in the United States remain worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report.  President Joe Biden adopted a more optimistic view, saying, \"Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country these last two months.

Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

I'll start by reading through the provided documents carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the incident happened on July 8, 2022. Shinzo Abe was shot during a campaign speech in Nara, western Japan. The documents mention that the suspect was Tetsuya Yamagami, who used a homemade gun. He was arrested immediately after the shooting.\n\nLooking further, it says that Yamagami was formally charged with murder and violating a gun control law. He underwent a mental evaluation for about six months, which concluded he was fit to stand trial. The motive mentioned is that Yamagami targeted Abe because of his perceived links to the Unification Church, which Yamagami's mother had donated to, causing his family financial ruin.\n\nThe timeline of the shooting is detailed: the first shot missed, the second hit Abe in the neck and chest. Abe was airlifted to a hospital but was pronounced dead at 5:03 pm, about five and a half hours after the shooting. The cause of death was blood loss from damaged arteries.\n\nI also note the international reaction, with leaders like Joe Biden expressing condolences, and flags being lowered in the US. This shows the significant impact of Abe's assassination.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the killer is Tetsuya Yamagami, and the assassination occurred on July 8, 2022, in Nara, Japan.\n</think>\n\nShinzo Abe was assassinated by Tetsuya Yamagami on July 8, 2022, in Nara, Japan. Yamagami shot Abe with a homemade gun during a campaign speech. Abe was pronounced dead at 5:03 pm due to blood loss from injuries sustained in the shooting.

Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.", "(Kyodo News via AP)       TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors formally charged the suspect in the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with murder, sending him to stand trial, a court said Friday. Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court.  Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.  Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if convicted.", "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his “deepest condolences” to former leader Abe, saying he “was a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time.”           Kishida said he had a “great respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind” and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs.           News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.

Abe's security detained the suspect, who did not resist.[75][76] According to security guards stationed during the assassination, the sound of the gunshot was very different from that of a conventional firearm, reminiscent of fireworks or tire blowout. This may explain the delay of response from Abe's bodyguards after the first round of gunshot.[77]  Paramedics arrived on the scene at 11:37 am, and an ambulance later arrived at 11:41 am.[78] Six out of the twenty-four emergency responders at the scene later showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Nara City Fire Department.[78]  Police sources told NHK that Abe was initially conscious and responsive after being shot.[79] A doctor who arrived at the scene said there were no signs indicating Abe was conscious.[80] Shortly thereafter, he was transported to a local hospital by emergency helicopter with a wound to the right side of his neck and internal bleeding under his left chest, arriving approximately fifty minutes after being shot.[81] He was reported to have no vital signs when he arrived at Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest prior to his arrival.", "Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a divisive arch-conservative and one of his nation’s most powerful and influential figures, has died after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in western Japan, hospital officials said.(AP Photo/Hiro Komae) People pray at a makeshift memorial at the scene where the former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot while delivering his speech to support the Liberal Democratic Party’s candidate during an election campaign in Nara, Friday, July 8, 2022.

Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party.

He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned an MBA from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak undertook an internship at Conservative Central Office, and joined the Conservative Party. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.

Wait, no, that's the Standard tier. Let me check again. Oh, here it says the Basic plan is 990 JPY/month, which is ad-free. Then the Standard with ads is 1,490 JPY/month, but wait, no—the Standard with ads is 1,490 JPY/month, while the Basic without ads is 990 JPY/month. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because the names might be mixed up.\n\nLooking at the second document, it mentions that Netflix launched the ad-supported tier in November 2022, called Standard with ads, which costs $7 a month. It also refers to the Basic plan without ads at $9.99 a month. Wait, now I'm getting conflicting information. In the first document, the Basic plan is 990 JPY without ads, and the Standard with ads is 1,490 JPY. But the second document refers to the ad-supported tier as Basic with ads at $6.99, which is cheaper than the Standard plan. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. In the first document, under the plans section, it lists:\n\n- Standard with ads: 1,490 JPY/month\n- Basic: 990 JPY/month (ad-free)\n- Standard: 1,490 JPY/month (ad-free)\n- Premium: 1,980 JPY/month\n\nSo the Basic without ads is 990 JPY, and the Standard with ads is 1,490 JPY. But the second document says that the Basic with ads is $6.99, which is cheaper than the Standard without ads. Wait, that doesn't match up with the first document. \n\nI think there might be a mistake here. The first document seems to have the Basic without ads at 990 JPY, and the Standard with ads at 1,490 JPY. But the second document refers to the ad-supported tier as Basic with ads at $6.99, which is lower than the Standard plan. This inconsistency is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me go back. The second document says that the ad-supported tier is called Standard with ads and costs $7 a month, which is cheaper than Disney+ and HBO Max's ad tiers at $10. So in the second document, the ad-supported tier is Standard with ads at $7, while the Basic without ads is $9.99. But in the first document, the Basic without ads is 990 JPY, and the Standard with ads is 1,490 JPY. So the names are swapped in terms of pricing.\n\nI think the correct information is that the ad-supported tier is cheaper. So in the second document, the Basic with ads is $6.99, which is cheaper than the Standard without ads at $9.99. But in the first document, the Basic without ads is 990 JPY, and the Standard with ads is 1,490 JPY, which is more expensive. That's conflicting.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. Let me check the third document. It says that the Basic with Ads tier is $6.99, which is almost 55% lower than the Standard plan. So the Basic with Ads is cheaper. Therefore, the correct pricing should be that the Basic with Ads is cheaper than the Basic without Ads.\n\nWait, but in the first document, the Basic without ads is 990 JPY, and the Standard with ads is 1,490 JPY. That would mean the ad-supported plan is more expensive, which contradicts the other documents. So there must be a mistake in the first document. \n\nI think the correct information is that the ad-supported tier is cheaper. Therefore, the Basic with Ads is $6.99/month, and the Basic without Ads is higher. But looking at the first document, it's structured differently. Maybe the first document is incorrect in labeling.\n\nSo, to answer the question: How much do the Netflix Basic with Ads and without Ads subscription cost? The Basic with Ads is $6.99/month, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99/month. Wait, but in the first document, the Basic without ads is 990 JPY, which is approximately $7, but that's without ads. So perhaps the correct answer is that Basic with Ads is cheaper than Basic without Ads.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to summarize:\n\nFrom the second document:\n- Basic with Ads: $6.99/month\n- Standard without Ads: $9.99/month\n\nFrom the first document:\n- Basic without Ads: 990 JPY (~$7)\n- Standard with Ads: 1,490 JPY (~$10)\n\nThis is conflicting because the ad-supported tier should be cheaper, but in the first document, the ad-supported tier (Standard with ads) is more expensive than the Basic without ads. That doesn't make sense because ad-supported tiers are usually cheaper.\n\nTherefore, the correct information is from the second document where Basic with Ads is $6.99, and the Basic without Ads is higher. So the answer should be that the Basic with Ads is $6.99/month, and the Basic without Ads is $9.99/month.\n</think>\n\nThe Netflix Basic with Ads subscription costs $6.99 per month, while the Basic without Ads subscription costs $9.99 per month. \n\nAnswer: The Netflix Basic with Ads subscription costs $6.99 per month, and the Basic without Ads subscription costs $9.99 per month.", "docs": ["Netflix offers a variety of plans to meet your entertainment needs.

According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers.

While filming has not yet begun, White has teased that he’s interested in exploring \"death and Eastern religion and spirituality.\" Considering that the show has already ventured to an American state and a European resort, creating a new installment set in Asia would certainly allow the series to go in a different direction.

Let me go through the document step by step.\n\nFirst, the document mentions that Republicans are preparing to take over the House, with Kevin McCarthy announcing his run for speaker. It also notes that the GOP might take control by a slim margin. So that suggests the House is likely under Republican control.\n\nLooking at the Senate part, the document has a section about the 2022 midterm elections. It states that the Senate is split 49-49 between Democrats and Republicans, with one Independent and one Independent Democrat, both caucusing with Democrats. This means Democrats effectively have 51 seats because the two Independents side with them. Therefore, the Senate is controlled by Democrats.\n\nWait, but the document also mentions the 118th Congress, which is from 2023 to 2025. It says the Senate has 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans, 1 Independent, and 1 Independent Democrat, all caucusing with Democrats. That adds up to 51 for Democrats, so they maintain control.\n\nSo putting it together, after the 2022 midterms, the House is controlled by Republicans, and the Senate by Democrats.\n</think>\n\nAfter the 2022 midterm elections, the House of Representatives is controlled by the Republican Party, while the Senate is controlled by the Democratic Party. \n\n**House:** Republican control  \n**Senate:** Democratic control", "docs": ["“Whether it’s Angie Craig talking about capping insulin for seniors, or Matt Cartwright talking about taking on price-gouging, or Abigail Spanberger talking about the work she did to secure police funding, our incumbents had accomplishments to run on,” Hayden said. “What Republicans said in their ads were: ‘Gas prices, they’re high!’ And that was the end of the ad. They never said what they’d do.” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Democratic agenda items like “lowering prescription drug costs and standing up for reproductive rights,” and driving that contrast with Republicans were “crucial to winning independents, turning out young people, and defying the odds in one of the hardest midterm environments on record.” Former President Donald Trump, who has teased that he plans to launch a third White House bid on Tuesday night, has been railing against fellow Republicans on his Truth Social platform while claiming without any evidence that \"very strange things\" were happening as regular vote counting processes continued in Nevada and Arizona. But even as Congress's future remains unclear, Republicans were already preparing to take over in the House for the first time since 2018. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has announced his run for speaker and has formed transition teams to oversee setting up a GOP majority that is not yet assured. Should the GOP take control of the chamber, it's likely to be by a slim number of seats, and keeping members in lockstep could be a challenge.", "From 1934-2018, the incumbent party has on average defended 237 seats in the House  and 17 in the Senate. Again, our graphs show that the more seats the party defends, the greater the number lost (correlations of r = 0.35 for House and r=0.57 for Senate). Presidents defending numbers of seats similar to those at stake in 2022 have lost 8 and gained 18 in the House (Eisenhower and G. W. Bush).  They have lost 3 and gained 14 in the Senate (Reagan and FDR). What about the economy, stupid? Some observers expect a negative effect for Biden from recent inflation, but that may be offset by positive news on jobs. For this analysis, we examined inflation (CPI) and nonfarm jobs growth.  Both variables have sometimes seemed important in forecasting presidential elections. Jobs growth figures look quite good for Biden at a year-over-year rate of over 4%. These figures are among the three highest midterm-election-year observations in the period 1946-2018. Inflation is not so great, clocking in recently at 8.4%.  That's the second highest reading in a midterm year for the years we examine (exceeded by 1974). It is perhaps surprising that neither variable is strongly correlated with midterm seat gains or losses.", "In the 2020 presidential election, President Biden won 224 districts, and Donald Trump won 211. Under new districting, Biden won 226 districts, and Trump won 209. Voters typically engage in “straight ticket” voting, meaning that they vote the same way for the House and Senate as they do for presidential elections. However, when breaking down the 2020 election results further, the number of districts that Trump won by more than 15 points goes from 132 under old maps to 143 under new maps. Under new district lines, there are only 33 districts that either Trump or Biden won by fewer than five percentage points. In this year’s House race, 33 districts were rated as toss ups, which made the 2022 midterm election close.

Her victory allows the Democrats to retain control the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote even without a victory in the Georgia runoff in December. Cortez Masto benefited in mail ballot counting since Election Day, winning in Clark County, which accounts for three-quarters of Nevada’s population. Laxalt saw his lead of some 19,000 votes after election night dwindle to nearly 900 on Saturday before the latest counted votes were added to the tally.  The AP determined Cortez Masto’s lead would carry through additional updates in Reno’s Washoe County as well as among provisional and “cured” ballots, or those with signature or date issues. Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.

That answers the second part of the question—the wedding date was November 19, 2022.\n\nNow, for the wedding dress designer. The document states that Naomi wore a dress inspired by Grace Kelly's wedding gown. It specifically mentions that the dress was a high-necked gown, similar to Kelly's. The designer's name isn't immediately obvious, but looking further, the document talks about a designer named Alexandra O’Neill from Markarian. It mentions that O’Neill worked closely with Naomi to create a custom dress. There's a quote from O’Neill discussing the design process, including details like hand-beaded fringe and satin with little trains. \n\nAdditionally, the document notes that Naomi changed into a strapless ivory silk Mikado Reem Acra dress for the reception and later a Markarian mini-dress for dancing.

She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.   The project was a joy for O’Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.", "Lopez topped them all, though, donning three custom dresses from Lauren for her nuptials with Ben Affleck last summer.

It wasn’t the only special touch included in Naomi’s multiple wedding looks, as her Ralph Lauren gown also contained lace from Dr Jill Biden’s own wedding dress, which was stitched into the bodice. The president’s granddaughter then switched into a third dress, a beaded fringed Markarian mini-dress, for some late-night dancing, according to Vogue.  According to Noami, the wedding dress she wore to exchange vows with Neal was inspired by the high-necked gown famously worn by actress Grace Kelly when she married Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956. “Like every little girl, I had a vision in my head – it was Grace Kelly’s dress I loved,” she told Vogue. Meanwhile, Jill Biden, who is affectionately referred to as “Nana” by her grandchildren, wore a teal wool crepe coat and silk chiffon dress by Reem Acra for the wedding ceremony, followed by a gold embroidered, seafoam blue dress also by Acra for the reception. According to Vogue, the first lady beamed when she saw her granddaughter in her wedding dress for the first time. “Oh, honey!” she said, as she stretched out her arms for a hug.", "Dolan, who published the aptly-named wedding photography book “The Perfect Imperfect” last year, was one of several authors at the nuptials.

Victoria earrings and the groom sported a Schlumberger single brooch from the company. Other members of the bridal party and Jill Biden also wore Tiffany jewels.   \tLike many Gen Z brides, Biden didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder on her wedding day and arranged for other custom designer choices for her rehearsal dinner and reception. After sporting a Danielle Frankel bustier top, tailored jacket, pants and cape to Friday night’s rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, the dark-haired lawyer wore a custom white beaded fringe dress from Markarian’s Alexandra O’Neill at Saturday night’s reception at the White House.

Only in the very dying seconds did you find yourself wondering whether Spain might be prepared to accept the defeat that ensured they and Japan knocked Germany out. Just before then, however, they had crafted an opening for Olmo and seemed to finally be poking holes in the defense. Considering Luis Enrique was unaware his side had, for a few seconds at least, been bound for the exit door, it is hard to be certain that they were entirely aware of events 30 miles away. Equally, come Friday morning they may feel a degree of thankfulness to Doan and Tanaka for firing them to the other side of the bracket. Resolute Morocco may well be a tougher test than an ageing Croatia might have been but beyond that the likes of Portugal, Serbia or Switzerland would make for nowhere near as intimidating a quarter final opponent as Brazil, a matchup with whom seemed inevitable on matchday one.

Let me start by looking at the provided documents to gather the necessary information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the documents to find any mentions of group stages or match highlights. The initial document lists the qualified and eliminated teams but doesn't specify the groups. However, it does provide some match details which might help.\n\nLooking further, I see that the document mentions groups like Group A, Group C, and Group G. For example, it talks about Group A having Netherlands, Ecuador, and Senegal, with Qatar being eliminated. Then, there's a mention of Group C, which includes Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Poland. The highlights from matches in Group C are listed, such as Argentina vs. Saudi Arabia and Mexico vs. Poland.\n\nAdditionally, there's a mention of Brazil in Group G, with a highlight from their match against Switzerland. So, from this, I can deduce that Argentina is in Group C and Brazil is in Group G.\n\nNext, I need to find their first opponents. The document lists the match between Argentina and Saudi Arabia on November 22, which I assume is their first match. Similarly, Brazil's first match would be against Serbia, but I don't see that explicitly mentioned here. However, since the document mentions Brazil in Group G and their match against Switzerland, perhaps their first opponent was Serbia, as that's a common grouping.\n\nWait, the document does mention a match between Brazil and Switzerland on November 28, so maybe their first match was against Serbia before that. Since the document doesn't explicitly state Brazil's first opponent, I might need to infer it based on standard groupings, but I should be cautious.\n\nPutting it all together, Argentina is in Group C and their first opponent was Saudi Arabia. Brazil is in Group G, and while the document doesn't specify their first opponent, it's likely Serbia, as that's a common opponent in that group.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any explicit mentions. The document does list the match between Brazil and Switzerland, but not their first game.

The new trailer also offers a closer look at the movie’s soundtrack, which features new music from Dua Lipa and Nicki Minaj.  Fans got a first look at the full cast for Barbie where the film’s official social media channels shared 24 individual posters featuring the core cast of Barbies, Kens, and humans!

It was uninspiring.” Speculation about Robbie’s casting as Barbie first began in 2015, after a Sony email leak reportedly revealed that she was among the actresses potentially being considered to play the famous doll. Years later, in October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Robbie was in talks to star in and produce the film with Warner Bros.  She also wasn’t the only star attached to the film. In 2016, Amy Schumer had reportedly landed the role but dropped out a few months later due to scheduling conflicts, according to THR. In 2017, Anne Hathaway was  reported to possibly star.  Greta Gerwig has been attached to the Barbie flick since 2019, when she was confirmed to write the script with Noah Baumbach.

Margot Robbie told British Vogue that she's aware that the Barbie character \"comes with a lot of baggage. And a lot of nostalgic connections. But with that comes a lot of exciting ways to attack it.\"   The film is scheduled to hit theaters on July 21, 2023, a date that's anticipated by kids and adults alike.

This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid).

Let me start by reading through each document carefully to extract the relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the document from March 28, 2023, it mentions that Google has opened access to an AI chatbot named Bard. Users have to join a waitlist to test it. So that's Google's chatbot: Bard.\n\nNext, I see another document from November 5, 2022, which talks about Google's LaMDA AI. It describes LaMDA as flexible, capable of imagining scenarios and providing guides. However, this seems to be an older version or a different model because the March 2023 document refers to Bard as the new chatbot. I might need to check if LaMDA is the same as Bard or a different product. But from the context, it seems like Bard is the newer one being released after LaMDA was discussed earlier.\n\nMoving on, another document discusses Baidu's AI efforts. It mentions the Ernie bot, which is based on Baidu's AI model called Enhanced Representation through Integration (ERNIE). The CEO, Robin Li, showcased this bot during a presentation. So Baidu's chatbot is Ernie Bot.\n\nThere's also a mention of ChatGPT by OpenAI, which is a competitor, but that's not relevant to Google or Baidu.\n\nAnother document from the CEO of Google discusses their AI investments and mentions the Transformer research project and diffusion models but doesn't specify the name of the chatbot. However, since we already have Bard from the March document, that's the one to focus on.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Google's new AI chatbot is called Bard, and Baidu's is called Ernie Bot.\n</think>\n\nGoogle's new AI chatbot is called **Bard, and Baidu's new AI chatbot is called **Ernie Bot.", "docs": ["Mar 28, 2023 ...

A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman! Now, before anyone gets any ideas, the setup to this particular story is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI.

The company's Ernie bot is based off its AI-driven deep learning model, Ernie - short for \"Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration\". During the presentation at Baidu's Beijing headquarters that was also livestreamed over nine platforms, Li cautioned it was not perfect. \"So why are we unveiling it today?

Whether it’s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. It’s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help people.

It provides details about his background, education, and career before founding Stability AI in late 2020. It also mentions that the company is funded by Mostaque himself and other investors like Eros Investments.\n\nSo, putting it together, David Holz founded MidJourney, and Mohammad Emad Mostaque founded Stability AI. The document doesn't mention any conflicting information, so I can confidently state this as the answer.\n</think>\n\nDavid Holz founded MidJourney, and Mohammad Emad Mostaque founded Stability AI.", "docs": ["Sep 16, 2022 ... David Holz, founder of the AI text-to-image generator, MidJourney has big plans for the technology's future, including text-to-3D ...", "Mohammad Emad Mostaque  (Bengali: মোহম্মদ ইমাদ মোশতাক) is the founder and CEO of Stability AI, one of the companies behind Stable Diffusion.[2][4][5][6]  Mostaque was born on April 1983 to a Bengali Muslim family in Jordan. He was taken to Dhaka, Bangladesh a month after his birth, and migrated with his family to the United Kingdom at the age of seven.[3] He is a graduate of the University of Oxford.  At age 19, Mostaque met his wife while on a student trip to the United States. He has been diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD. In his twenties, he became interested in helping the Islamic world by creating online forums for Muslim communities and developing \"Islamic AI\" which would help guide people on their religious journey.[3]  After graduating, Mostaque went on to spend 13 years working at various hedge funds in the United Kingdom.[7][2]  In 2019 Mostaque founded Symmitree, a startup that aimed to reduce the cost of technology for individuals living in poverty, which he worked on for 1 year.[2]  In late 2020 Mostaque founded Stability AI.[2] Much of the company's funding comes directly from Mostaque, as well as other investment companies such as Eros Investments.", "He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that’s been surprising to me.", "As per Holz, Midjourney is meant to augment our capabilities, not replace us by any means.  “It’s kind of like the moment humans invented cars. Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

It mentions that the llamas have been doing this since 1986, replacing horses because they have a lighter impact on the trails. The llamas are led by a wrangler and take about four hours to reach the lodge. This document is about real llamas, not the AI models, so it doesn't help with the question.\n\nSecond document: This is about a personal experience with a llama hike at Capitol Reef National Park. The author learned about training llamas for reliability and drew parallels to training people for better experiences. The key principles mentioned are taking individual differences into account and spending adequate time on training. Again, this is about real llamas, not the AI models.\n\nThird document: This one discusses the LLaMA model, Meta's actions regarding a DMCA takedown, and reactions to the model's leak. It also mentions that HuggingFace complied with requests and GitHub took down a repository. There's a mention of RedPajama project by Together to reproduce and distribute an open-source version of the LLaMA dataset. It also thanks Yizhong Wang and Yifan Mai for their help, and the Stanford NLP Group and CRFM for feedback. Additionally, it mentions code and documentation to train Stanford's Alpaca models.\n\nFrom this, I can infer that LLaMA was developed by Meta, as they filed the DMCA takedown, which suggests ownership. The Alpaca models are mentioned as being trained by Stanford, as the document refers to \"Stanford's Alpaca models\" and thanks the Stanford NLP Group and CRFM, which are affiliated with Stanford.\n\nSo, putting it together: LLaMA was trained by Meta, and Alpaca was trained by Stanford.\n</think>\n\nLLaMA was trained by Meta, while Alpaca was trained by Stanford. \n\nAnswer: LLaMA was trained by Meta, and Alpaca was trained by Stanford.", "docs": ["GET 60% OFF OUTSIDE+                                 One Subscription to Fuel All Your Adventures                                   SUBSCRIBE NOW                        Create a personalized feed and bookmark your favorites.

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.", "Advancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted to try something different, something exciting, something I’d never done before.  So we went on a two-hour llama hike.  When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us. But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?", "Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience?  After we got home, I called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way. Is the audience medical students or physicians?", "HuggingFace complied with the requests.[16] On March 20, Meta filed a DMCA takedown request for copyright infringement against a repository containing a script that downloaded LLaMA from a mirror, and GitHub complied the next day.[17] As of March 25, Facebook has not responded to the pull request containing the magnet link.[14]  Reactions to the leak varied. Some speculated that the model would be used for malicious purposes, such as more sophisticated spam. Some have celebrated the model's accessibility, as well as the fact that smaller versions of the model can be run relatively cheaply, suggesting that this will promote the flourishing of additional research developments.[3] Multiple commentators, such as Simon Willison, compared LLaMA to Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image model which, unlike comparably sophisticated models which preceded it, was openly distributed, leading to a rapid proliferation of associated tools, techniques, and software.[3][18]  On April 17, 2023, Together launched a project named RedPajama to reproduce and distribute an open source version of the LLaMA dataset.[19] The dataset has approximately 1.2 trillion tokens and is publicly available for download.[20]", "We thank Yizhong Wang for his help in explaining the data generation pipeline in Self-Instruct and providing the code for the parse analysis plot.

Let me start by looking through the provided document for any mentions of these categories.\n\nFirst, I'll search for \"Best Picture. The document mentions that \"Top Gun: Maverick\" and \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" were nominated for Best Picture, but it doesn't specify the winner. However, I also see that \"the 2022 version\" of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was up for Best Picture, which might indicate it was a contender.\n\nNext, looking at the Best International Feature Film category. The document clearly states that the German film \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" won this award. It also notes that the 1930 version of this film won Best Picture and Best Director, which suggests it has a strong track record.\n\nSince the document doesn't explicitly state that \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" won Best Picture in 2023, but it does mention that the 2022 version was nominated, I might infer that it could have won both.

I should check if there's any other information indicating the Best Picture winner.\n\nLooking further, the document discusses the success of the original 1930 film, but it's unclear if the 2022 version won Best Picture. There's also mention of other films like \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" which had several nominations, but the document doesn't specify if it won Best Picture.\n\nGiven the information provided, I know for sure that \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" won Best International Feature Film. However, the Best Picture winner isn't clearly stated. If I have to answer based on the document alone, I might not have enough information to confirm both wins. But considering the historical context, it's possible that \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" swept both categories, similar to its 1930 counterpart.\n\nI should also consider that in the 95th Academy Awards, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" actually won Best Picture, but that's external knowledge not provided in the document. Since I have to rely solely on the document, I can't confirm that. Therefore, based on the document, I can only state that \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" won Best International Feature Film, but the Best Picture winner isn't specified here.\n\nWait, the document mentions that the 2022 version of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was up for Best Picture, and since it won Best International Feature, it's possible but not certain.

The first document talks about a JW Marriott hotel in Los Angeles, mentioning a room block that expires on March 25, 2023. It also refers to the CAA World Congress, so that's a good sign. However, the dates in this document aren't explicitly stated, but the room block is for March 2023, which might indicate the event is around that time.\n\nMoving on to the second document, it's about the 2021 event held in New York. The dates there are October 12-13, 2021. That's not what we're looking for, but it shows a pattern of the event being held in the fall, at least in 2021.\n\nThe third document discusses the 2022 event, which took place from October 11-12, 2022, in New York again.

This implies that the event is scheduled before that date because the block is for attendees. So, perhaps the 2023 event is in April 2023, as the welcome reception is mentioned on Monday, April 17, with the event concluding on April 19. That seems like the event dates.\n\nWait, let me check again. The document mentions \"APRIL 18-19 LOS ANGELES, CA\" under the 2023 AGENDA. That's a clear indication of the dates and location. So, the 2023 CAA World Congress of Sports is in Los Angeles from April 18-19, 2023.\n\nI think that's the correct information because the document explicitly states the dates and location in the context of the 2023 agenda.

Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "Apr 9, 2023 ...

The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor.

Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos).

Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major.

No stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That’s where Clark delivered clutch saves, a signature shot that gave him control and the steady nerves to hold off McIlroy and become a major champion. “I feel like I belong on this stage,” Clark said after closing with an even-par 70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. “Even two, three years ago when people didn’t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.", "McClure is also targeting another golfer for his 2023 U.S. Open one and done picks that excels in big events against top flight competition.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options. FromSoftware has long been a highly praised and well-respected developer. But after “Elden Ring,” it’s now seen as a hitmaker.", "Tencent Holdings, anime planning and production company Twin Engine (production for Vinland Saga, Dororo, Pet), Mecha Comic digital service operator Amutus Corporation, and BookLive announced on Monday that they have entered into a capital tie-up.

I remember reading some documents that mentioned MATANA, but I'm not exactly sure which companies are included. Let me go through the document step by step.\n\nFirst, the document talks about Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Microsoft. These are all big tech companies. I also remember seeing the term MATANA mentioned in the context of stock picks or investments. The document discusses each company's performance and future projections.\n\nLooking at the sections, it starts with Tesla, highlighting their growth and valuation. Then it moves on to Apple, talking about their product launches and stock reactions. Amazon is next, with a cautious outlook but positive future expectations. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is discussed with a focus on their search dominance and expected growth. Microsoft is covered as well, noting their strategic positioning and investments in AI.\n\nThe document also mentions other companies like Netflix and Nvidia in different contexts, but the main focus seems to be on Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. The term MATANA is used when talking about Wall Street's bullish stance on Alphabet, and later Microsoft is mentioned as the next best upside after Alphabet.\n\nWait, in the document, it's mentioned that \"MATANA\" is a group of stocks, similar to FAANG, which stands for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. So, MATANA might be a new acronym representing a group of prominent tech companies. The document lists Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix, and Microsoft, but the exact composition isn't explicitly stated.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about MATANA. The document doesn't explicitly define MATANA as an acronym, but from the context, it seems to include companies like Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, as these are the ones discussed in the sections where MATANA is mentioned.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think MATANA includes Tesla (T), Apple (A), Amazon (A), Alphabet (N), and Microsoft (M). Wait, that would make it TAANM, not MATANA. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the letters. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the document refers to MATANA as a stock pick, and the companies discussed in that section are Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. The order in the acronym would then be M (Microsoft), A (Apple), T (Tesla), A (Amazon), N (Netflix), A (Alphabet). Wait, that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just the first letters: M for Microsoft, A for Apple, T for Tesla, A for Amazon, N for Netflix, and A for Alphabet. But that would make MATANA as M-A-T-A-N-A. But the document doesn't explicitly state this, so I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, the document actually mentions \"the MATANA stock\" in the context of Alphabet, so maybe MATANA is a group that includes multiple companies, but the exact composition isn't clearly defined in the provided text. However, the companies discussed around MATANA are Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.\n\nI think the best approach is to list the companies mentioned in the document that are associated with the MATANA discussion. Therefore, the companies part of MATANA are likely Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.\n</think>\n\nThe companies part of MATANA, based on the context provided, are Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Microsoft. These companies are highlighted in the document as key players in the tech sector with significant growth and investment potential.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe companies part of MATANA are Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Microsoft.", "docs": ["But it is a car company, and in the less than 20 years since it was founded in 2003, it has disrupted the automotive sector. In 2021, Tesla was ranked as the most valuable automotive brand in the world. That same year, it was deemed the fastest growing brand on the planet. Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021. The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock. Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months.", "As it continues to regroup from a post-pandemic hangover, Amazon gave a cautious outlook for the first quarter of 2023. The extent to which retail spending and digital transformation are on hold won’t be known until Amazon reports Q1 results in late-April. The Street thinks better news and big gains lie ahead.  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a projected gain that’s right behind that of Amazon. The consensus price target is just shy of $130, which means 37% separates Alphabet from its current bogey. It’s upside that seems reasonable considering the online search king is down roughly the same percentage from its February 2022 peak.  Wall Street's unanimously bullish position makes Alphabet a more compelling MATANA pick. Over the past three months, a perfect 32 of 32 firms have called Alphabet stock a ‘buy.’ It's hard to take a contrarian stance when more than two dozen analysts who eat, sleep and breathe the company see Alphabet stock heading higher.  The reset button has effectively been hit for Alphabet after reporting just 2% revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Yes, advertisers have pulled back spending in a weakened economy, but it doesn’t change Google’s command of the search market. As macro conditions improve, ad dollars will return because they have to — 76% of today’s searches happen on Google.  This dominance has the Street expecting a return to double-digit profit growth within the next few years.", "It’s highly unlikely that this herd of bulls has the long-term forecast wrong.  There’s a big jump down to the MATANA stock with the next best upside, and that’s Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality.

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.
