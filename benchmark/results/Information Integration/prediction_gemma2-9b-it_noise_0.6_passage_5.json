The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score.

There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics.

As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations.

Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989.

The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation. The result was a clear violation of a Bell inequality and agreed with the predictions of quantum mechanics.", "The Nobel committee said in a statement that “click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions have taken chemistry into the era of functionalism,” adding that “this is bringing the greatest benefit to humankind.” Among her many awards, Bertozzi is a recipient of the 2014 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy’s highest scientific honor.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.

Clemons brings relatability to a role that is, at its core, a non-heroic character. Susie's bubbliness and happy veneer put a fresh face on the type of character who wants fame so badly that they'll do anything to achieve it. Wolff brings his own brand of vulnerability to the film as Jesse, who's too pure for the world he inhabits.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for.

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.            Following the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland.", "The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.  The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.", "The hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II's coffin stopped briefly as it arrived in the town of Windsor, west of London, on Monday afternoon, so troops from the British Army's Grenadier Guards could take their places flanking the vehicle for it's slow, final push to Windsor Castle. Once the procession reaches the grounds of Windsor Castle, it will be joined by King Charles III and the other senior members of the royal family. The Royal Standard, a flag representing the Sovereign and the United Kingdom, was raised over Windsor Castle on Monday as the hearse carrying Queen Elizabeth II's coffin made its way through west London toward Windsor.  The standard always flies above any royal castle or palace when the sovereign is there, so it being raised on Monday was a sign that the late queen's son, King Charles III, had arrived at the royal residence ahead of the committal service for his mother. Queen Elizabeth II will be laid to rest at the family's cemetery at St. George's Chapel, on the Windsor Castle grounds. Queen Elizabeth II made her final procession through London on Monday after the state funeral service was held for her at Westminster Abbey. Throughout the process, her coffin was heavily decorated in regalia, all representing various aspects of the queen's life and legacy.  Royal contributor Tina Brown told CBS News that the items that draped and sat on top of the queen's coffin added historic symbolism to this \"moving moment."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA.

Awards  Winners of the 2023 Golden Globes include “House of the Dragon,” “Fabelmans,” “Abbott Elementary” and “The Banshees of Inisherin.”   The 80th Golden Globe Awards — which honors projects across film and television  and typically kicks off the awards season — will air at 5 p.m. Pacific Tuesday on NBC and will be streamed on the network’s premium Peacock service. The show will take place at its usual haunt, the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.  In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes’ return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show’s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?

Who was former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe?", "82][3][83] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors [were] doing everything they [could]\".[84]  Abe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67 years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.", "66][70][71] The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around, at which point a second shot was fired, hitting Abe in the neck and chest area.[72][73][74] Abe then took a few steps forward, fell to his knees, and collapsed. Abe's security detained the suspect, who did not resist.[75][76] According to security guards stationed during the assassination, the sound of the gunshot was very different from that of a conventional firearm, reminiscent of fireworks or tire blowout. This may explain the delay of response from Abe's bodyguards after the first round of gunshot.[77]  Paramedics arrived on the scene at 11:37 am, and an ambulance later arrived at 11:41 am.[78] Six out of the twenty-four emergency responders at the scene later showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Nara City Fire Department.[78]  Police sources told NHK that Abe was initially conscious and responsive after being shot.[79] A doctor who arrived at the scene said there were no signs indicating Abe was conscious.[80] Shortly thereafter, he was transported to a local hospital by emergency helicopter with a wound to the right side of his neck and internal bleeding under his left chest, arriving approximately fifty minutes after being shot.[81] He was reported to have no vital signs when he arrived at Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest prior to his arrival.", "96] Five vehicles carrying various old professional acquaintances of Abe's, including former defence minister Tomomi Inada, took part in the motorcade conveying Abe's body back to his home in Tokyo. At 1:35 pm, the party arrived at Abe's Tokyo residence. On their arrival, Sanae Takaichi, the chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council, Tatsuo Fukuda, the chairman of the LDP General Council[97] and Hisashi Hieda, the chairman of Fujisankei Communications Group and a friend of Abe's, received them.

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening. Still, the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices, with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5,000. There was a single sale for $9,999, but it’s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase.
