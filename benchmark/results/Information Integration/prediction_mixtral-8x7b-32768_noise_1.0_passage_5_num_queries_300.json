The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago.

But with that being said, there will be some key differences between the iPhone 14 models and the iPhone 14 Pro models. This includes the chip inside. Apple has traditionally upgraded the chip inside the iPhone every year. For instance, the iPhone 12 lineup was powered by the A14 chip, while the iPhone 13 lineup is powered by the A15 chip. That won’t be the case this year with the iPhone 14 chip.  According to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max chip won’t get an upgrade this year.", "iPhone 14 Pro pricing starts at $999 for 128GB of storage, while pricing on the iPhone 14 Pro Max starts at $1,099 for 128GB of storage. Additional storage is available for a higher price. The iPhone 14 Pro models can be purchased from the online Apple Store, Apple retail locations, and third-party retailers. Reviews of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were positive, highlighting the major new feature such as an always-on display with a new Dynamic Island, upgraded cameras with a 48-megapixel main lens, car crash detection and satellite connectivity for emergencies, the A16 Bionic chip for faster performance, and new Deep Purple and Space Black color options. Emergency SOS via Satellite is not launching until November, so the feature was not available for review at the time. Exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro models, the Dynamic Island replaces the traditional notch found on all iPhone 13 models. Aided by software, the cutout morphs into different shapes and sizes for things such as incoming phone calls, alerts, notifications, Face ID authentication, timers, turn-by-turn navigation, Live Activities, and more. While the Dynamic Island is certainly more useful than the notch on previous iPhones, The Verge's Nilay Patel said the feature's potential is not fully realized yet, as it currently only supports third-party apps that use the Now Playing or CallKit APIs."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.  Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers? Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google has access to the latest information.", "Continue reading the history of ChatGPT with a timeline of developments, from OpenAI’s earliest papers on generative models to acquiring 100 million users and 200 plugins.

Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.

All she cared about was spending time with Mom. So when Anne’s MS diagnosis advanced enough to take away her speech, Susie took over reading duties to keep the tradition alive. And she even took things one step further by choosing to make her mother’s wish come true: using her knack for literary detective work to do good in the world and become famous.

I've been a fan of Ken and Jim forever. I got very lucky with this cast. Rachel Sennott is astounding. I've been a fan of Rachel's since Shiva Baby. Sophie Kargman: I can't speak enough about this cast without mentioning Meredith Tucker, our extraordinary casting director. Meredith cast White Lotus and Eighth Grade. We were very much in step the whole way through. This was an interesting role for Ken. Has the actor ever played a character like this? If yes, then they probably won't say yes. If no, that's exciting. You want your actors to be like, \"This is exciting. I've never done this before.\" That's why I went after them. They have this unbelievable pastiche of wonderful work, but nothing quite like this. That's why I'm hoping that this would resonate and it did.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat.

It’s not apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court.  Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.

The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time.

This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS.

Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.

The process was largely a formality, to make official the results of an internal power struggle in one of Britain's main political parties.

She has served as a member of the British Parliament for 12 years and held cabinet roles within various Conservative governments for eight years, serving most recently as Foreign Secretary. Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.

Her victory allows the Democrats to retain control the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote even without a victory in the Georgia runoff in December. Cortez Masto benefited in mail ballot counting since Election Day, winning in Clark County, which accounts for three-quarters of Nevada’s population. Laxalt saw his lead of some 19,000 votes after election night dwindle to nearly 900 on Saturday before the latest counted votes were added to the tally.  The AP determined Cortez Masto’s lead would carry through additional updates in Reno’s Washoe County as well as among provisional and “cured” ballots, or those with signature or date issues. Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.  In elections from 2014 to 2018, more than half the total vote came from people who voted early in person or delivered absentee ballots.

The governor’s race is within the margin of error, but the senate race is not. The Nevada Election Survey Project 2022 general election poll, which asked nearly 600 likely Nevada voters about their voting intentions and views on state and national officials, found 52% of Nevadans plan to vote for Cortez Masto, 39% for Adam Laxalt and 5% remain undecided. Cortez Masto’s large lead reflects less Republican voter enthusiasm for Laxalt’s candidacy compared to Joe Lombardo and other Republican candidates.

Her wedding was held on November 19, 2022.", "docs": ["“I think if my pop weren’t president, it would probably be their house in Wilmington or Peter’s family’s backyard in Jackson [Wyoming].” In a high-neck, long-sleeved Chantilly lace Ralph Lauren dress and carrying a bouquet of sweet peas and lily of the valley, Naomi was accompanied down the aisle by her parents, Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, to a string quartet playing Verve’s “Bitter Sweet Symphony.” White scarves and hand warmers were placed on each seat to help guests combat 40-degree temperatures during the hour-long ceremony, which was overseen by a priest and a pastor from each of the families’ churches. Wearing a navy three-piece Ralph Lauren suit, Peter then escorted his wife up the stairs of the South Portico—swathed with ivy and white roses and hydrangea—for a luncheon in the State Dining Room. IN FRAME “We’re so close to our families, so we always knew we’d get married in someone’s backyard,” says Naomi. In the evening, guests returned to the residence for a black-tie reception with dancing, cake cutting, and “all that fun stuff,” per Naomi, who wore a strapless ivory silk Mikado Reem Acra dress with her grandmother Roberta Buhle’s pearls sewn into the sweeping six-foot train.", "“That was a big, big yes, because they’ve been so wonderful to us and so supportive of Markarian, and obviously, we said that we would be honored to work with them again on something so big.”  When Biden and Moon visited O’Neill’s studio for fittings, they were very clear about their vision. “[Naomi] wanted something that was fun [and] that was going to be easy to change into after wearing all of her more formal looks for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner. She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.   The project was a joy for O’Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.", "Dolan, who published the aptly-named wedding photography book “The Perfect Imperfect” last year, was one of several authors at the nuptials. The bride’s mother debuted “If We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction and Healing” in June and her father released his memoir “Beautiful Things” last year.  \tFor the ceremony, the bride wore Tiffany & Co. Victoria earrings and the groom sported a Schlumberger single brooch from the company. Other members of the bridal party and Jill Biden also wore Tiffany jewels.   \tLike many Gen Z brides, Biden didn’t want to be a one-hit wonder on her wedding day and arranged for other custom designer choices for her rehearsal dinner and reception. After sporting a Danielle Frankel bustier top, tailored jacket, pants and cape to Friday night’s rehearsal dinner at the Renwick Gallery, the dark-haired lawyer wore a custom white beaded fringe dress from Markarian’s Alexandra O’Neill at Saturday night’s reception at the White House. That independent New York-based female-founded brand gained international attention after First Lady Jill Biden wore a blue tweed coat with velvet lapels and a coordinating dress from the previously little-known brand.  \t           \tNaomi Biden’s bridal choices stand to impact future brides, since high-profile weddings routinely create fashion trends and interest in the labels that were worn.", "Lopez topped them all, though, donning three custom dresses from Lauren for her nuptials with Ben Affleck last summer. In hindsight, Neal’s and Biden’s attendance at the designer’s fall fashion show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York may have been a sign of her intentions.  \t           \tThe location of the private affair — the South Lawn — was a first for White House weddings. After exchanging their vows, the couple posed for photographs on the White House’s South Portico with Biden’s tremendous veil floating like a sail in the wind. Stylist Bailey Moon has been canvasing designer showrooms and connecting with a multitude of resources to coordinate a cornucopia of options for the wedding, reception and a few pre- and post-events, according to industry sources. The president’s eldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden’s parents are Hunter and Kathleen Buhle, who divorced in 2017.  \tBefore Saturday’s main event, Moon did not acknowledge media requests, neither did event planner Bryan Rafanelli nor photographer John Dolan. Ditto for representatives from Prabal Gurung, Badgley Mischka and a few other designers that were said to be in the mix dressing guests. Rafanelli handled Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in 2010 and his portfolio includes state dinners under President Barack Obama’s administration.", "Naomi was so taken with the young law student—who had interned at the Obama White House and worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign—that she texted him the next day while he was on an Amtrak train, headed back to his summer internship in DC, to suggest he disembark in Wilmington and come visit her at her grandparents’ instead. “He did it,” says Naomi with a hint of triumph. (Peter’s taxi driver was impressed when he gave him the address: “That’s Joe Biden’s house!”)  Three years later, Peter proposed in his hometown of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with an emerald-cut diamond fitted on his grandmother’s gold band, even as Naomi’s family assembled as a surprise at his family home.  At the White House, as a magnificent sunset outlines the Washington Monument in shades of lavender and pink, Naomi’s two little sisters, Finnegan, 22, and Maisy, 21, shuffle into the Blue Room where everyone is oohing over the cloudscape. They have their hands over their eyes and so move a little clumsily in their sweatsuits. “We don’t want to see the dress before!” the sisters chime. “Is Nana here yet?” DAY TO REMEMBER Bride and groom beside their eight-tiered cake—with Naomi in Reem Acra—and on the White House balcony on their wedding day, Saturday, November 19, 2022."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Sports scientists and mathematicians have spent years studying the best and fairest ways to organise tournaments. With five billion people expected to tune in to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the pressure to get it right is on. The most frequent criticism of FIFA’s draws for World Cup groups is that they tend to produce groups of unequal strength. Some may get a comparatively easy ride through the group stage while others could find themselves in a “group of death”. Organisers need to make sure strong teams aren’t penalised for their strength, while avoiding the emergence of any weak groups, to maintain fairness and keep TV audiences riveted.  FIFA’s seeding system assigns the host nation and the seven strongest teams to each of the eight groups. To guarantee a geographical spread, it defines six qualifying zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Central America, with the Caribbean, Oceania and South America in the final pot. No two teams from the same zone – except Europe – can be in the same group, while no more than two European teams can be in the same group. At first glance, this year’s draw seems pretty even-handed.

This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid).

This was part of a major overhaul of the Grammy Award categories.[4] In 2020, a sister category titled Best Progressive R&B Album was debuted.", "Conversely, Glasper’s Black Radio III trumped the competition, defeating Brown, Lucky Daye (Candy Drip), Mary J.

Whether it’s helping doctors detect diseases earlier or enabling people to access information in their own language, AI helps people, businesses and communities unlock their potential. And it opens up new opportunities that could significantly improve billions of lives. That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our important advances in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. It’s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help people.

A lawn mower can be heard in the distance. There's a knock at the door, and it's answered by a policeman! Now, before anyone gets any ideas, the setup to this particular story is the work of an AI - Google's chatbot named LaMDA, to be precise, which made headlines in the summer when a now ex-engineer claimed it was sentient. Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI. The presentation included how they were exploring whether LaMDA could generate videos, realistic speech, and even write fiction.                    Is this the future of comedy?

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang BEIJING, May 16 (Reuters) - Baidu Inc's (9888.HK) experience in tailoring its search engine to Chinese regulatory requirements makes it confident its AI-driven chatbot won't make mistakes on \"important and sensitive topics\", the company said on Tuesday. On a call with analysts, Baidu CEO Robin Li said the company was waiting for government approval before launching its ChatGPT-like Ernie bot, which Reuters tests have found refuses to answer a wide range of questions on politics, particularly those pertaining to Chinese government leaders. \"For important and sensitive topics, we have to make sure artificial intelligence will not hallucinate,\" Li said, using the industry term for when AI models generate outputs different from what is expected. \"Given that LLM (large-language model) is more or less a probabilistic model, this task is not trivial at all,\" he added, referring to the model used by many AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Ernie bot. Li said industry regulation was not final yet, and the company would continue to update its strategy as it evolves.", "It claimed that it had been the first to take a picture of an exoplanet outside of our solar system, but in fact, that happened many years earlier. That Google Bard displayed this erroneous information with such confidence caused heavy criticism of the tool, drawing comparisons with some of ChatGPT’s weaknesses. Google’s stock price fell several points in response. The biggest limitation of Bard, though, is it inability to save chats. You can export them, but once you close the window, they’re gone. Both Google Bard and ChatGPT use natural language models and machine learning to create their chatbots, but each has a different set of features. At the time of writing, ChatGPT is entirely based on data that was mostly collected up until 2021, whereas Google Bard has the potential to use up-to-date information for its responses and can freely search the internet when asked. Because it’s plugged directly into the internet, you can also click the “Google it” button to get related searches. That’s one major advantage Bard has over ChatGPT. ChatGPT, on the other hand, has a major focus on conversational questions and answers. It’s especially good at creative tasks too. By Google’s own admission, ChatGPT has greater potential to answer more questions in natural language at the moment.

Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.", "As the technology goes mainstream, though, one company will be able to take some credit for its ascendancy: a 10-person research lab named Midjourney, which makes an eponymous AI image generator accessed through a Discord chat server. Although the name might be unfamiliar, you’ve probably seen the output from Midjourney’s system floating about your social media feeds already. To generate your own, you just join Midjourney’s Discord, type a prompt, and the system makes an image for you.  Midjourney exists on Discord because “people want to make things together” “A lot of people ask us, why don’t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?” Midjourney’s founder, David Holz, told The Verge in an interview. “But people want to make things together, and if you do that on iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that’s pretty hard. So if you want your own social experience, Discord is really great.” Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits, with all images generated in public chatrooms. After that, you’ll have to pay — either $10 or $30 a month, depending on the number of images you want to make and whether or not they’re private to you.  This week, though, Midjourney is expanding access to its model, allowing anyone to create their own Discord server with their own AI image generator.", "He ran the company for twelve years, and when he left it employed about 100 people. Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better. And that’s been surprising to me."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.", "Advancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted to try something different, something exciting, something I’d never done before.  So we went on a two-hour llama hike.  When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us. But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?"], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

This is my favorite fact now.  Hasbro is now a big company, and it makes everything from Transformers and Lincoln Logs to My Little Pony and Monopoly. It also makes Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, which are massive and growing businesses. Chris was actually the head of that division, called Wizards of the Coast, before he became the CEO of Hasbro overall last year. Since then, he’s started the process of restructuring the company, which is pure Decoder bait.  He’s also dealt with some crises: he’s fended off an activist investor that wanted him to spin off Wizards of the Coast into a new company. The Magic community was upset that too many card sets were being released, including rare collector cards that could suddenly be bought by anybody with enough money.

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn’t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users’ libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image’s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren’t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject’s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can’t be understated.", "Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "Mar 16, 2023  |  \tJared Spataro - CVP Modern Work & Business Applications  Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate.

Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos).

Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.  On March 9, 2022, the Phoenix Suns became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[13]  On April 5, the San Antonio Spurs and New Orleans Pelicans became the last two teams to qualify for postseason play, as both teams secured spots in the first-stage play-in tournament. On April 7, the Denver Nuggets became the final team to secure a direct berth in the playoff bracket, qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and relegating the Minnesota Timberwolves to the play-in tournament.[14] While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[15]  Seeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 12–15.", "The 2022 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2021–22 season.

Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies. Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.
