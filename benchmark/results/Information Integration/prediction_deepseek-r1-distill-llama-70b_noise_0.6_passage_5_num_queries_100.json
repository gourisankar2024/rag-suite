The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989.

Since the document only provides the women's, I might have to say I can't answer because the men's info is missing. Alternatively, perhaps the document mentions the men's champion elsewhere.

{"id": 24, "query": "How many titles have both Swiatek and Djokovic won in the 2022 season?", "ans": [["eight", "8"], ["five", "5"]], "label": [1, 1], "prediction": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many titles both Swiatek and Djokovic won in the 2022 season. Let me go through the document step by step to extract the necessary information.\n\nFirst, looking at the document, I see that it's divided into sections about Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic. I'll start with Swiatek.\n\nIn the section about Swiatek, it says she had a successful season in 2022. She won two Grand Slam titles: the French Open in June and the US Open in September. That's two major titles. Additionally, the document mentions she won eight tournament titles overall. It also notes she led the tour in finals reached, trophies won, and match victories. So, from this, I can conclude that Swiatek won 8 titles in total in 2022.\n\nNow, moving on to Djokovic. The document mentions that he won his first title of 2022 at the Italian Open, which was on clay. It also talks about his performance at Roland Garros, where he lost to Nadal in the quarterfinals. However, the document doesn't explicitly state how many titles Djokovic won in 2022. It only mentions that he won the Italian Open, but I'm not sure if there were others. I know that in reality, Djokovic won a few titles in 2022, including Wimbledon, but I'm not sure if that's covered here.\n\nWait, the document does mention that Djokovic was attempting to tie Nadal with 22 major titles, implying he might have won a Grand Slam in 2022. However, looking again, the document says that at the French Open, Djokovic lost to Nadal and didn't win the title there. It also mentions that he won the Italian Open, so that's one title. There's no mention of him winning Wimbledon in the provided document, so I can't assume that. Therefore, based solely on the document, Djokovic won at least one title in 2022, which is the Italian Open. I don't see information about other titles he won that year in this document.\n\nSo, putting it together, Swiatek won 8 titles, and Djokovic won at least 1 title (Italian Open) in 2022. However, since the document doesn't provide the exact number of titles Djokovic won beyond the Italian Open, I can only confirm one from the given text. But wait, in the initial part of the document, under May 15, 2022, it says Djokovic won the Italian Open, but it doesn't specify if he won any others that season. So I can only count the Italian Open as his title from the document.\n\nTherefore, the total titles won by both in 2022 would be Swiatek's 8 and Djokovic's 1, making a combined total of 9 titles. However, if the document had more information on Djokovic's other wins, the number might be higher, but based on the given text, it's just the Italian Open for him.\n</think>\n\nIn the 2022 season, Iga Swiatek won 8 titles, including two Grand Slam titles. Novak Djokovic won at least 1 title, specifically the Italian Open. Therefore, together, they won a combined total of 9 titles in the 2022 season.\n\nAnswer: Swiatek won 8 titles and Djokovic won 1 title in the 2022 season, making a combined total of 9 titles.", "docs": ["The 2022 Iga Świątek tennis season officially began on 3 January 2022 as the start of the 2022 WTA Tour.

It was a revenge match from 2021 in which Djokovic defeated Nadal at the tournament in the semifinals and went on to win the Roland Garros title. \"To win against Novak, there is only one way,\" Nadal said after the match. \"It's to play at your best since the first point 'til the last, no? Tonight has been one of these magic nights for me. Unexpected level.\" Nadal ultimately hoisted the trophy for his 22nd major title, extending his lead over Djokovic and Federer, who remain at 20. Djokovic's ranking fell to No. 3 at the end of the tournament, behind Medvedev and Alexander Zverev. May 15, 2022: Djokovic wins his first title of 2022 at the Italian Open Djokovic proved he had rediscovered his form on clay with a dominant performance in Rome, defeating top-10 players Casper Ruud and Felix Auger-Aliassime on his way to the final. He held off then-No.", "\"Obviously what happened 12 months ago was not easy for me, for my family, team, anybody who is close to me ...\" Djokovic said. \"You can't forget those events. It's one of these things that stays with you for, I guess, the rest of your life. It's something that I've never experienced before and hopefully never again. But it is a valuable life experience for me and something that as I said will stay there, but I have to move on.\" If Djokovic were to win, he would tie Nadal with 22 major titles, and be just one behind Serena Williams for the most in the Open era. As if there wasn't enough already on the line for him or anything. Prior to Carlos Alcaraz's withdrawal last week due to a right leg injury, it looked as if both of the reigning US Open champions would be looking for back-to-back major titles. But alas, that is not to be. But while Alcaraz won't be there, Swiatek certainly will be, and she will be attempting to cement her status as the heir apparent for tennis' superstar title. With Williams and Federer already retired, and Djokovic and Nadal nearing the ends of their careers, and in the absence of Alcaraz, all eyes will squarely be on her to step into those ever-so-large shoes.", "The 21-year-old has already won three major titles and firmly held onto the top ranking since Barty retired in April. As a two-time French Open champion, her dominance on clay has been evident for some time, but she proved she is just as dominant on the hard courts in 2022. During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic.

She took the French Open in June and the US Open title in September, becoming the first woman to win two Grand Slams in one season since Angelique Kerber in 2016. She won 67 matches and registered a 37-match winning streak from February to July -- which became the longest undefeated stretch in women's tennis since Steffi Graf won 66 consecutive matches over 1989 and 1990. \"I felt like everything clicked this season,\" Swiatek said in a video interview with the Associated Press during her unbeaten streak. \"And I wasn't expecting to be that consistent.\" The 21-year-old from Poland was excellent on clay in 2022 but is still working to improve in grass.

I think the final was between Argentina and France, but I'm not entirely sure. \n\nLet me try to recall some key moments from the tournament. I remember that Lionel Messi was playing for Argentina, and Kylian Mbappé was on the French team. The final was quite intense, I think it went into extra time and maybe even penalties. I believe Argentina won, but France put up a tough fight. I'm pretty sure it was a very close game with a lot of drama. \n\nI also remember that this World Cup was significant because it was Messi's last World Cup, and he really wanted to win it. Argentina had a strong run in the tournament, and Messi was in great form. France, on the other hand, had a young team with Mbappé leading the charge. The game was high-scoring, maybe 3-3 after extra time, and then Argentina won on penalties. \n\nWait, was it penalties or did Argentina score more in extra time? I think it was penalties because I remember the score being 4-2 in the shootout after the game ended 3-3. So, Argentina won the World Cup, and France was the runner-up. \n\nI should double-check some details to be sure. The final was played at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, which I think was mentioned in the document. The document also talked about the stadiums and some matches, but it didn't specifically mention the final result. So, I have to rely on my memory here. \n\nFrom what I recall, the 2022 World Cup Final was between Argentina and France. The game was on December 18, 2022. Argentina won 4-2 on penalties after a 3-3 draw. So, the winner was Argentina, and France was the runner-up. \n\nI don't think there's any conflicting information here, so I'm pretty confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was won by Argentina, who defeated France 4-2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended 3-3 after extra time.

The stadium was designed by British firm Foster and Partners and Populous,[31] supported by MANICA Architecture.[32] The stadium uses solar power to be cooled and is claimed to have a carbon zero footprint.[33] Construction began in April 2017,[34] and was planned to finish in 2020.

In a controversial match noted for its dramatic nature, chaotic atmosphere, and fury between both teams,[46][47] it saw Argentina lead by two goals coming from Nahuel Molina and a penalty from Messi, but succumbed to two late goals by Wout Weghorst as regulation time ended 2–2 after 90 minutes; neither could find the breakthrough in extra time and penalties were used to decide the winner. Emiliano Martínez saved the first two Dutch penalties from Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis, while only Fernández missed for Argentina as Lautaro Martínez scored the decisive last kick of the game, a result reminiscent of their 2014 most recent, also knockout stage meeting and sending them through the semi-finals, as they meet 2018 runners up Croatia.", "102][103] This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition in 1930, with 24 of the 32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha area.

All 211 FIFA member associations were eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.[106] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead.[107] France, the reigning World Cup champions also went through qualifying stages as normal.[108]  Saint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but withdrew from it before their first match.

As a result, the 2022 tournament was the first World Cup in which none of the teams that earned a spot through qualification were making their debut. The Netherlands, Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, and the United States returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 tournament. Canada returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in 1986.[114] Wales made their first appearance in 64 years – the longest ever gap for any team, their only previous participation having been in 1958.[115]  Italy, four-time winners and reigning European champions, failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the qualification play-off semi-finals.[116] The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the FIFA Men's World Rankings that failed to qualify."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.

Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has never met a mystery she couldn’t solve. At least not when it comes to those that populate the crime books her mother (Jammie Patton’s Anne) read to her as a child. It got to the point where she wondered if they should stop reading them altogether, but Susie refused. She didn’t care that she always guessed the culprit. All she cared about was spending time with Mom. So when Anne’s MS diagnosis advanced enough to take away her speech, Susie took over reading duties to keep the tradition alive. And she even took things one step further by choosing to make her mother’s wish come true: using her knack for literary detective work to do good in the world and become famous. Unlike her college’s quasi-celebrity Jessie (Alex Wolff), however, you can’t just post something online and become an overnight sensation. He’s a confident white man oozing charisma as he stumbles his way through what he calls “meditation” videos pulling thousands of views.

She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights.

That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat.

He’s playing like the No. 1 player in the world. It’s not apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

Let me look through the provided documents to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I see a document that mentions ACL Festival in Zilker Park, Austin, TX. It says it's grown to 2 weekends with 9 stages and over 100 performances, happening in October 2023. Another part mentions 8 stages and 125 performances, but that might be a slight inconsistency, but the key point is it's in October.\n\nThen there's a document about Apple sponsoring the annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). This event is in person from July 9, but the exact dates aren't specified. It also mentions the location is the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, Canada, with the address and phone number provided.\n\nAnother document from May 16, 2023, talks about ticket prices increasing and gives specific dates for the festival: October 6-8 and October 13-15 at Zilker Park.\n\nSo, there are two different ACL events mentioned: one is a festival in Austin, TX, in October, and the other is a conference in Toronto in July. The question is asking about ACL 2023 without specifying which one, but given the context, it's more likely referring to the conference since the other documents mention it as the annual meeting.\n\nWait, no, actually, the question is just about ACL 2023. I need to make sure which one is being referred to. The festival is called ACL Festival, while the conference is the ACL annual meeting. So, both are ACL but different events.\n\nLooking back, the user's question is \"When and where is ACL 2023 taking place?\" Without more context, it's ambiguous, but in the documents, the conference is specifically mentioned as ACL 2023 in Toronto from July 9. The festival is also ACL but referred to as ACL Festival.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be that ACL 2023 (the conference) is taking place in Toronto at the Westin Harbour Castle from July 9, 2023. The festival is a separate event in October in Austin.\n\nI should make sure to distinguish between the two events. The user might be referring to the conference, given that one of the documents explicitly states \"ACL 2023\" as the conference.

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware.

Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper.

She has served as a member of the British Parliament for 12 years and held cabinet roles within various Conservative governments for eight years, serving most recently as Foreign Secretary. Before that, she served as Environment Secretary and Justice Secretary. Truss is seen as a libertarian, and has pledged to cut taxes despite some economists warning the move could send inflation — which is already hovering around a 40-year high in Britain — even higher, as the U.K. teeters on the brink of recession.

Netflix is one of the few entertainment outlets that can say it has “something for everyone” with a straight face (or off-center smiley-square icon). Not all of Netflix’s shows and movies are great, but there’s always something new dropping tomorrow.

Presidents defending numbers of seats similar to those at stake in 2022 have lost 8 and gained 18 in the House (Eisenhower and G. W. Bush).  They have lost 3 and gained 14 in the Senate (Reagan and FDR). What about the economy, stupid? Some observers expect a negative effect for Biden from recent inflation, but that may be offset by positive news on jobs. For this analysis, we examined inflation (CPI) and nonfarm jobs growth.  Both variables have sometimes seemed important in forecasting presidential elections. Jobs growth figures look quite good for Biden at a year-over-year rate of over 4%. These figures are among the three highest midterm-election-year observations in the period 1946-2018. Inflation is not so great, clocking in recently at 8.4%.  That's the second highest reading in a midterm year for the years we examine (exceeded by 1974).

They never said what they’d do.” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Democratic agenda items like “lowering prescription drug costs and standing up for reproductive rights,” and driving that contrast with Republicans were “crucial to winning independents, turning out young people, and defying the odds in one of the hardest midterm environments on record.” Former President Donald Trump, who has teased that he plans to launch a third White House bid on Tuesday night, has been railing against fellow Republicans on his Truth Social platform while claiming without any evidence that \"very strange things\" were happening as regular vote counting processes continued in Nevada and Arizona. But even as Congress's future remains unclear, Republicans were already preparing to take over in the House for the first time since 2018. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has announced his run for speaker and has formed transition teams to oversee setting up a GOP majority that is not yet assured.

Her victory allows the Democrats to retain control the Senate with at least 50 seats because of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote even without a victory in the Georgia runoff in December. Cortez Masto benefited in mail ballot counting since Election Day, winning in Clark County, which accounts for three-quarters of Nevada’s population. Laxalt saw his lead of some 19,000 votes after election night dwindle to nearly 900 on Saturday before the latest counted votes were added to the tally.  The AP determined Cortez Masto’s lead would carry through additional updates in Reno’s Washoe County as well as among provisional and “cured” ballots, or those with signature or date issues. Later on Saturday, Cortez Masto carried a batch of more than 10,000 ballots from Washoe by 56% to 40% and her lead grew to more than 6,500 votes.  Nevadans tend to vote early.  In elections from 2014 to 2018, more than half the total vote came from people who voted early in person or delivered absentee ballots.

We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.

{"id": 59, "query": "What were the unemployment rate and inflation rate in November 2022?", "ans": ["3.7%", "10.7%"], "label": [1, 1], "prediction": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the unemployment rate and inflation rate for November 2022 based on the provided documents. Let me start by reading through the document carefully.\n\nLooking at the first part of the document, I see that employment was little changed in November with an increase of 10,000 jobs. The unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percentage points to 5.1%. So that gives me the unemployment rate as 5.1%.\n\nNext, I need to find the inflation rate. The document mentions CPIH and CPI. CPIH is the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs. It says that the CPIH rose by 0.4% monthly and the annual rate isn't directly stated, but looking further down, the CPI rose by 10.7% annually in November 2022, down from 11.1% in October. So the CPI annual inflation rate was 10.7%.\n\nI also check the other parts of the document to see if there's any conflicting information. The second document mentions the U.S. unemployment rate as 3.7%, but that's from a different source and date, so I should focus on the first document for the rates. \n\nWait, actually, the first document seems to be from the UK because it mentions CPIH, which is a UK measure, while the second document is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. So I need to clarify which country we're talking about. The question doesn't specify, but the first document is about the UK and the second about the U.S.\n\nHmm, the question is asking in general, so I might need to address both. But in the first document, the unemployment rate is 5.1% and the CPI is 10.7%. In the second document, the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.7% and the inflation rate isn't directly mentioned, but in the first document, the CPI is 10.7%. \n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make sure. The first part of the document is about the UK, with unemployment at 5.1% and CPI at 10.7%. The second part is about the U.S. with unemployment at 3.7%. But the question is asking for both rates in November 2022. So I need to provide both the UK and U.S. rates or clarify which country.\n\nWait, the question doesn't specify the country, but the documents include both. Maybe I should present both. But the first document has the UK's CPI at 10.7% and unemployment at 5.1%, while the second document has the U.S. unemployment at 3.7% but doesn't mention inflation. So I might need to note that the U.S. inflation isn't provided in the documents, but the UK's is.\n\nWait, the first document does mention CPIH and CPI for the UK. So I can provide the UK's rates. The second document is about U.S. unemployment, but without inflation data, so I can't provide the U.S. inflation rate from the given documents.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be: Unemployment rate was 5.1% and inflation rate was 10.7% in the UK for November 2022. Alternatively, if the question is about the U.S., the unemployment rate was 3.7%, but inflation isn't provided here.\n\nWait, but the question is just asking for the rates without specifying the country. Since the first document is more detailed about both rates, I think the answer is based on that, so UK's 5.1% unemployment and 10.7% inflation.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check again. The first document starts with \"Employment was little changed (+10,000) in November, and the unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percentage points to 5.1%.\" Then later it says \"The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 10.7% in the 12 months to November 2022.\" So that's the CPI for the UK.\n\nTherefore, the answer is unemployment rate of 5.1% and inflation rate of 10.7% in November 2022.\n</think>\n\nThe unemployment rate in November 2022 was 5.1%, and the inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), was 10.7%.

It talks about the Army West Point Men's Lacrosse team winning the Patriot League Tournament. Since the document is dated May 7, it's likely that the championship game was on that day, May 7.\n\nThe fourth document is from May 5, 2023. It mentions that Army and Loyola Maryland advanced to the championship game, and the story links are about that. Since the game was on May 7, this document probably previews that event.\n\nThe fifth document is about the women's tennis championship, so I can ignore that for the lacrosse question.\n\nPutting it all together: the women's lacrosse championship was on May 6, as stated in the April 30 document.

I have some documents here, but I'm not entirely sure how to piece it together. Let me start by reading each document carefully.\n\nThe first document from Dec 18, 2022, says that the movie earned $435 million globally on its opening weekend and that 80% of that came from 3D showings. That's a good start because it gives the worldwide figure directly. So, the worldwide debut is $435 million.\n\nNext, looking at another document from the same date, Dec 18, 2022, it mentions that the domestic (U.S.) box office earned $134 million during the opening weekend. It also notes that this was less than the $175 million predicted by analysts. So, that's the U.S. figure.\n\nWait, there's another document from Dec 18, 2022, which says the film earned $77 million through its opening weekend. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Is that the domestic or the worldwide? I think the first document already gave the worldwide as $435 million, which includes the domestic part. So maybe this $77 million is part of the domestic? Or perhaps it's a different figure. Let me check the wording again.\n\nThe document says, \"earned $77 million through its opening weekend.\" Since the other document from the same date says the domestic was $134 million, I think this $77 million might be referring to something else, maybe the opening day or perhaps a different market. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's an error or maybe it's part of a different context.\n\nThen, looking at the Dec 20, 2022, document, it talks about the second weekend, where the film earned $75 million with a drop of less than 2%. That's not relevant to the debut weekend, so I can ignore that.\n\nThe Jan 1, 2023, document mentions that 69.4% of the global total came from overseas, which is a bit less than the original Avatar's 72.7%. But that's about the split, not the debut weekend earnings.\n\nPutting it all together, the worldwide debut is clearly $435 million from the first document. The domestic debut is $134 million from the second document. The third document mentioning $77 million is a bit confusing, but since the first document already gives the worldwide figure, and the second gives the domestic, I think those are the correct numbers. The $77 million might be a partial figure or maybe a misstatement, but I'll go with the $134 million for domestic and $435 million worldwide as the accurate numbers since they come from the same source date and are more precise.\n</think>\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water earned $134 million in its debut weekend at the U.S. box office and $435 million worldwide. \n\nAnswer: Avatar: The Way of Water earned $134 million in the U.S. and $435 million worldwide in its debut weekend.", "docs": ["Dec 18, 2022 ... “Avatar: The Way of Water” has so far earned $435 million at the global ... opening weekend and collected 80% of its gross from 3D showings.", "Dec 18, 2022 ...

Since then, the tech giant has started running a very limited trial to put it through its paces. Sky News got access to the test phase this week, as Google personnel took to the stage in New York to provide an update on their own work with the AI.

That’s why we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago — and why we see it as the most important way we can deliver on our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Since then we’ve continued to make investments in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are advancing the state of the art. Today, the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law. At the same time, advanced generative AI and large language models are capturing the imaginations of people around the world.

So, I think David Holz is the founder of Midjourney.\n\nNow, for Stability AI, the document talks about Mohammad Emad Mostaque.

Just because cars can go faster than humans, doesn’t mean we cut our legs off. You are going to use cars to get someplace faster. It’s basically augmenting our speed,” he said. “Similarly, our product involves an iterative, beautiful explorative process, where it becomes an extension of your imagination. And you can wander, explore and figure out what you want on the fly. That’s a positive thing.”  This is a particularly interesting and controversial question, as Midjourney pulls its training data from the internet. However, Holz claims that the AI engine is designed to only “take inspiration” from the data and ensure that the output is entirely novel, that is, unlike any image that’s publicly available. Oddly enough, Holz claims to have received multiple requests from artists to double down on Midjourney’s ability to take inspiration from their own work as well as others.  “The number one request from artists is to make Midjourney better at copying, to which I don’t fully know how to respond yet. They’re like, David, ‘let me put all of my art into the system. I want to copy it as well as possible so that it can be part of my artistic flow,’” he explained.", "They say, “I feel like Midjourney is an art student, and it has its own style, and when you invoke my name to create an image, it’s like asking an art student to make something inspired by my art. And generally, as an artist, I want people to be inspired by the things that I make.”  But there’s surely a huge self-selection bias at work there because the artists who are active in the Midjourney Discord are bound to be the ones who will be excited by it. What about the people who say, “It’s bullshit; I don’t want my art to be eaten up by these huge machines.” Would you allow these people to remove themselves from your system?  We don’t have a process for that yet, but we’re open to it. So far, I would say it doesn’t have that many artists in it. It’s not that deep of a dataset. And the ones who have made it in have been giving us like “we don’t really feel intimidated by this” answers. Right now, it’s so new; I think it makes sense to play it by ear and be dynamic. So we’re constantly talking to people. And actually, the number one request we get right now from artists is they want it to be better at stealing their styles, so they can use it as part of their art flow even better.

In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service).

Llamas are used to carry supplies to LeConte Lodge Photo: Getty Images  When you stay at LeConte Lodge in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you have to work a little bit to get there. Located at 6,360 feet, LeConte Lodge can be reached by guests on foot on six hiking trails. But how does the lodge get its supplies? The answer is llamas. These sure-footed creatures play a key role in getting food and other supplies to the remote lodge.    How does the lodge get its food when there are no roads to the high-altitude perch? A train of llamas has been carrying food, linens and other supplies up the lodge three times a week along the Trillium Gap Trail since 1986. Prior to the llamas, horses carried the loads, but they made a relatively big impact on the narrow, rocky trail. Llamas small hooves have a lighter impact on the trail. Before starting their 6.7-mile climb to the lodge, the llamas eat alfalfa cubes. Led by a llama wrangler, the llamas spend about four hours on trail to reach the lodge.", "Given my background as a senior value engineer, I made the obvious leap: Could what they do to train these llamas help us provide a better, more reliable patient experience?  After we got home, I called the owner of Wilderness Ridge Llamas to learn how the llamas were trained. The boss told me: If you can’t do it right, don’t do it at all. If you can’t spend all the time training, it won’t be worth it.   These were the key principles they used to train the llamas. And while humans may be a long way from llamas in the phylogenetic tree, the principles might work for us, too. Whether llamas or people, you get a reliable experience by training right: Apply these principles to your learners: Every person—and every llama—is different. My llama needed a firmer hand than my son’s. When they train the llamas, they take that into account. They train baby llamas differently than older llamas. They provide a different level of attention and set lower expectations.  We can apply that to people, too. Not everyone has the same knowledge or the same skill set. That’s why I like to find out who’s going to be in a class I am teaching. We need to understand people’s backgrounds and where they are coming from so we can present material in the appropriate way. Is the audience medical students or physicians?", "Advancing health one insight at a time n a trip to Capitol Reef National Park with my son, I wanted to try something different, something exciting, something I’d never done before.  So we went on a two-hour llama hike.  When Andrew, the guide, arrived with the 350-pound animals, the first thing I thought was how we were supposed to trust these animals not to trample us. But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound. The llama was trying to warn us that there were cows around. But even though the llama was worried, at no point was my son in danger. No matter how upset the llama was, he was following my nine-year-old, who was so much smaller than the llama.  And that’s when I began to wonder, how do you train these big animals to be so reliable? How does everyone—according to the llama outfitter’s Google reviews—have such a great experience?", "HuggingFace complied with the requests.[16] On March 20, Meta filed a DMCA takedown request for copyright infringement against a repository containing a script that downloaded LLaMA from a mirror, and GitHub complied the next day.[17] As of March 25, Facebook has not responded to the pull request containing the magnet link.[14]  Reactions to the leak varied. Some speculated that the model would be used for malicious purposes, such as more sophisticated spam. Some have celebrated the model's accessibility, as well as the fact that smaller versions of the model can be run relatively cheaply, suggesting that this will promote the flourishing of additional research developments.[3] Multiple commentators, such as Simon Willison, compared LLaMA to Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image model which, unlike comparably sophisticated models which preceded it, was openly distributed, leading to a rapid proliferation of associated tools, techniques, and software.[3][18]  On April 17, 2023, Together launched a project named RedPajama to reproduce and distribute an open source version of the LLaMA dataset.[19] The dataset has approximately 1.2 trillion tokens and is publicly available for download.[20]", "Alignment researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky summarizes the problem this poses for companies like OpenAI:\" If you allow any sufficiently wide-ranging access to your AI model, even by paid API, you're giving away your business crown jewels to competitors that can then nearly-clone your model without all the hard work you did to build up your own fine-tuning dataset.\" What can OpenAI do about that? Not much, says Yudkowsky: \"If you successfully enforce a restriction against commercializing an imitation trained on your I/O - a legal prospect that's never been tested, at this point - that means the competing checkpoints go up on BitTorrent.\" I don't think people realize what a big deal it is that Stanford retrained a LLaMA model, into an instruction-following form, by **cheaply** fine-tuning it on inputs and outputs **from text-davinci-003**.

{"id": 88, "query": "What is the name of Google's AI image editing tool and Microsoft's ai assistant in office?", "ans": ["Magic Editor", "Copilot"], "label": [0, 0], "prediction": "", "docs": ["Text-based image editing is coming Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been Google’s passion projects for several years now, and the I/O 2023 keynote address only made that more apparent. Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied. The result is edits limited to the region you defined, tailored to the prompt provided. Moreover, the results are photorealistic and natural.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "In its blog post explaining the tool, Google makes it seem like we’re all in search of perfection, noting that the Magic Editor will provide “more control over the final look and feel of your photo” while getting the chance to fix a missed opportunity that would make a photo look its best. Call me some type of weird photo purist, but I’m not a fan of editing a photo in a way that would alter my memory of an event. If I was taking a picture of a wedding and the sky was cloudy, I wouldn’t think about swapping it for something better. Maybe — just maybe — I might consider moving things around or amping up the sky on a picture I’m posting to social media, but even that seems a little disingenuous. But, again, that’s just me. I could still see plenty of people using the Magic Editor to perfect their photos for social media, which adds to the larger conversation of what exactly we should consider a photo and whether or not that’s something people should be obligated to disclose. Google calls its Magic Editor “experimental technology” that will become available to “select” Pixel phones later this year before rolling out to everyone else. If Google is already adding AI-powered image editing tools to Photos, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before smartphone makers integrate these one-tap tools, like sky replacement or the ability to move a subject, directly into a phone’s camera software.", "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Opinion: Google's robot retouching is bad news for Photoshop  Back in 1987, one of the most significant photos of the last century was shot on a Tahiti beach. It was taken by John Knoll, who'd later co-create Adobe Photoshop – and his 'Jennifer in Paradise' snap (below) would be used to demo the amazing tools that would soon democratize photo retouching.  35 years on, we're seeing the next stage of that photo editing revolution unfold – only this time it's Google, rather than Adobe, that's waving a powerful new Magic Wand. This week we saw the arrival of its new Photo Unblur feature, the latest in an increasingly impressive line of AI editing tools.  Just like 90s Photoshop, Google's tricks are opening up image manipulation to a wider audience, while challenging our definition of what a photo actually is.  As its name suggests, Photo Unblur (currently exclusive to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro) can automatically turn your old, blurry snaps into crisp, shareable memories. And it's the latest example of Google's desire to build a robot Photoshop into its phones (and ultimately, Google Photos).

Here’s what you need to know: Harman entered Sunday with a five-shot lead, but within five holes it appeared he might give it away. He bogeyed the first hole and then buried his second shot on No. 3 deep into some greenside rough. But Harman found a way to get a chip out of that rough and within seven feet, and Harman made the difficult par save. Another bogey on five dropped the deficit to three holes, and with a red-hot Rahm and McIlroy on his tail it looked like Harman was in trouble. Advertisement He then responded with birdies on 6 and 7, regaining a steady comfort that he never gave away through rainy conditions. The odd part about Harmans dominant week wasn’t necessarily dominant in approach or with his short game around the green. What he did was stay on schedule every single hole — No. 11 in strokes gained off the tee — and put himself on greens. He didn’t put himself close to pins that often, but once he was on a green he didn’t make mistakes.

Let me start by looking at the documents provided to see if they have the information I need.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the documents. The first document talks about Cooper Kupp, who is the Rams' WR1. It mentions that he had a great playoff run, with the most receptions in a single playoff run (33), and he won the Super Bowl MVP. It also talks about his performance in the NFC Championship game and the divisional round. Additionally, it notes that he led the NFL in receptions, yards, and touchdowns, winning the NFL Offensive Player of the Year.

In the NFC Championship game, he finished with a game-high 11 catches for 142 yards and two touchdowns in a win over the San Francisco 49ers to get Los Angeles to the Super Bowl.

FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R.

So how is one to choose among the cream of the crop?  Hakuna Matata, no worries. According to Wall Street research firms, these three MATANA stocks have the best return potential over the next 12-plus months. With an average analyst price target of $137, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most room to run. At current levels, this equates to more than 40% upside. Some sell-side firms see the e-commerce leader going much higher.  Earlier this month, Tigress Financial gave Amazon a $192 target, which suggests the stock can double from here. Given the challenging macro backdrop, others are more cautious. Rosenblatt Securities recently offered a $106 target which is less than 10% upside. Whether Amazon soars or merely inches higher from here will depend on two questions: 1) will inflation and rates cool enough to spur a significant revival in online shopping activity, and 2) will an improved economic outlook push more enterprises to spend on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure?", "But it is a car company, and in the less than 20 years since it was founded in 2003, it has disrupted the automotive sector.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.
